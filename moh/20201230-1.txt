CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
58810 is a Singapore Permanent Resident who works as a Marine Surveyor
at Lloyd’s Register Singapore. His work entails working onboard vessels
docked at Sembcorp Marine Admiralty Yard.
He developed acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms on 27 December,
and sought treatment at a general practitioner clinic on 28 December
where he was tested for COVID-19 as part of our enhanced community
testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with
ARI at first presentation to a doctor. He was confirmed to have COVID-19
infection the next day and was conveyed in an ambulance to the National
Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His serological test results has
come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.
He had not gone to work since onset of symptoms. His earlier tests from
Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) – the last being on 14 December – had
been negative for COVID-19 infection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including his family members,
have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the
start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close
contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.

treatment at a general practitioner clinic the next day, where he was
swabbed. His test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 29
December and he was conveyed to NCID in an ambulance. His serological
test result has come back negative, indicating a likely current
