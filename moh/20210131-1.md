His swab done on 31 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 29 January in preparation for another trip to India. His test result came back positive the next day, and he was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and his serology test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported based on his travel history. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the <a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annexesd77e5b78f5914a0ab6731f183292e0df.pdf?sfvrsn=ab38e189_0" title="Annexes">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH’s daily Situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 32 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
