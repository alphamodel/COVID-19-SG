In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,816 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are currently 15 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 65 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br>8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A 64 year-old male Singaporean has passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 26 February 2021. He had been residing in Indonesia from 17 March 2020, and had a past history of hyperlipidaemia. He tested positive for COVID-19 infection on 26 January 2021 while he was in Indonesia, and was hospitalised there on 27 January. He was subsequently medically evacuated to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) for treatment on 29 January, and his test taken in Singapore on 30 January also came back positive for COVID-19. NCID has reached out to his family and is extending assistance to them. As he was already an overseas registered case, he was not included in Singapore’s COVID-19 case count.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>27 FEBRUARY 2021</strong><br><br></div></body>
