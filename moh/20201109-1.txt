CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 8
Amongst the 8 imported cases, 3 (Cases 58246, 58247 and 58250) are
Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India, Bangladesh and
the UAE. Case 58250 had travelled to the UAE under the Business Travel
Pass. He had undergone a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test
upon return to Singapore, and self-isolated at home while waiting for
his test result. He was conveyed to the hospital after his test came
back positive the next day. His serological test result has come back
positive, which indicates likely past infection.
Another 4 are currently employed in Singapore. Of these, 2 (Cases 58244
and 58245) are Work Pass holders who arrived from South Korea and the
Philippines and the other 2 (Cases 58248 and 58251) are Work Permit
holders who arrived from Indonesia. The remaining case (Case 58249) is a
Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from India. They had all already
been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in Singapore and were tested
while serving SHN or upon arrival in Singapore.
3.     Please refer to the Annexes and MOHâ€™s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
5.     MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at
Toh Guan Dormitory (19A Toh Guan Road East) for the past two incubation
periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     6 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,981 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 34 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 21 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
