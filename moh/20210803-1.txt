CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5. 592 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and under
observation. There are currently 37 cases of serious illness requiring
oxygen supplementation, and 7 in critical condition in the intensive
care unit (ICU). 6 amongst these 44 cases are fully vaccinated. Of
these, 4 require oxygen supplementation while 2 require ICU care as they
have underlying medical conditions. 31 seniors above 60 years, of whom
27 are completely unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, have fallen very
ill.

6. There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 66 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 39 are unvaccinated, 21 are partially vaccinated and 6 are fully
vaccinated.

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES
7. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from
967 cases in the week before to 799 cases in the past week. We are
likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as we
step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the community.
The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased from 173
cases in the week before to 254 cases in the past week. The 7-day moving
average number of all linked community cases and all unlinked community
cases are 77.9 and 36.3 respectively.

ACTIVE CLUSTERS UNDER MONITORING
9. There are 8 new clusters today. In total, there are currently 100
active clusters, ranging between 3 and 1,097 infections. MOH has been
monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have
been no more cases linked to the Case 64388 cluster for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.
