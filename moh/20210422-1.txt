CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to a previous case.
Case 62234 is an 11 year-old male Indian national who is a Student’s
Pass holder. He is the child of Cases 62045[1] and 62143[2], and a
household contact of Case 61536[3]. He is a student at Dimensions
International College (58 Lowland Road).
As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 62045, he was
placed on home quarantine on 16 April. He was tested for COVID-19 on 17
April and 19 April during quarantine and his test results were negative.
On 21 April, he developed a fever and reported his symptom to MOH.
Another test was taken, and this time his result came back positive for
COVID-19 infection. He was conveyed in an ambulance to the National
University Hospital. His serology test result has come back negative,
indicating that this is likely a current infection.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today who is linked to a
previous case.

Case 62225, a 32 year-old male Bangladesh national, is a Work Permit
holder who arrived in Singapore in December 2018. He is employed by
Prosper Environmental & Engineering Pte Ltd as a construction
supervisor, and works at Sembcorp Marine Admiralty Yard (60 Admiralty
Road West). He resides at Westlite Woodlands Dormitory (2 Woodlands
Sector 2), and is the roommate of Case 62181[4].
As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 62181, he was
placed on quarantine at a government quarantine facility on 19 April. He
is asymptomatic, but was tested for COVID-19 on 20 April during
quarantine to determine his status. His test result came back positive
for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed to Tan Tock
Seng Hospital. His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 13 April –
were all negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result is
pending.
Case 62225 received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 13 March, and
the second dose on 3 April. This likely accounts for his lack of
symptoms. The COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic
disease for the vast majority of those vaccinated, but it is possible
for vaccinated individuals to get infected. Further research is required
to determine if the vaccination will also prevent onward transmission of
the infection. This is a reminder that we cannot afford to let our guard
down. Our existing key enablers – safe management measures, testing, and
contact tracing – continue to be necessary and effective in helping us
to mitigate spread and keep community transmission low.
As part of our investigations into Case 62181, MOH and the Ministry of
Manpower have commenced a special testing operations to test residents
of Westlite Woodlands Dormitory (2 Woodlands Sector 2) for COVID-19. So
far, 17 recovered workers were found to be positive for COVID-19. These
cases were immediately isolated and conveyed to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. MOH, together with an expert panel which comprises
infectious diseases and microbiology experts, is investigating if they
are re-infection cases or past infections but shedding fragments of the
virus.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 22
