CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2
There are 2 cases in the community today who are currently unlinked.
Case 60448
Case 60448 is a 33 year-old male Malaysian national who is a Work Permit
holder employed by PSA Corporation Ltd as a lashing specialist.
He arrived from Malaysia on 23 December 2020 and served SHN at a
dedicated facility until 6 January 2021. His swab taken on 3 January
during SHN was negative for COVID-19.
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 21 February
as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came
back positive for COVID-19 the next day. An individual test was done on
23 February, and he was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 24
February. He was subsequently conveyed in an ambulance to the National
Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT – the last
being on 13 February – were negative for COVID-19 infection. His
serology test result has come back positive but we have assessed that
this is likely a current infection.
Case 60448 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine on 22 January, and the second dose on 14 February. This accounts
for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing
antibodies following vaccination. However as it typically takes a few
weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing
vaccination, he was likely to have been infected before he was conferred
protection after vaccination.
Case 60470
Case 60470 is a 27 year-old female Singapore Permanent Resident who
works as a tuition teacher at the Yishun branch of Berries World of
Learning School (18 Yishun Avenue 9).
She developed a runny nose on 23 February after work and sought medical
treatment at a General Practitioner clinic the next day where she was
tested for COVID-19 as part of our enhanced community testing to test
all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute
respiratory infection at first presentation to a doctor. Her test came
back positive for COVID-19 infection on 25 February, and she was
conveyed in an ambulance to Singapore General Hospital. Her serology
test result is pending.
As a precautionary measure, the Yishun branch of Berries World of
Learning School will be closed until 28 February for cleaning and
disinfection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 8
Amongst the 8 imported cases,
• 2 (Cases 60450 and 60453) are Singaporeans and 2 (Cases 60449 and
60455) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India, Nepal
and Sri Lanka.
• 3 (Cases 60451, 60457 and 60459) are Work Permit holders who arrived
from Indonesia and the Philippines, all of whom are foreign domestic
workers.
• 1 (Case 60454) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
India to visit her family member who is a Singapore Permanent Resident.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
