CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 5
There are 5 cases in the community today who are linked to previous
cases.
Cases 62348, 62349, 62350 and 62365
Cases 62348, 62349, 62350 and 62365 are sea crew working on board bunker
tanker MT ALLI. They had not disembarked from the vessel except to go
for COVID-19 testing or vaccination.
As they had been identified as close contacts of Case 62113 [1], they
were placed on quarantine on 16 April. Amongst them, 3 are asymptomatic,
while Case 62350 developed a cough on 21 April but did not report his
symptom. They were tested for COVID-19 on 22 April during quarantine,
and their test results came back positive on the same day. Their
serology test results are pending.
Cases 62348 and 62350 received their first doses of COVID-19 vaccine on
15 April and 7 April respectively. As it typically takes a few weeks for
an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination, they
were likely to have been infected before they were conferred protection
after vaccination.
Case 62373
Case 62373 is a 45 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who is a
senior executive at Wirana Shipping Corporation. His parents arrived
from India on 15 April. His father, Case 62049, tested positive for
COVID-19 infection for his on-arrival swab, and was admitted to a
hospital. His mother was placed on quarantine from 16 April to 30 April
at a government quarantine facility as she had been identified as a
flight close contact of Cases 62029 and 62030 [2]. She tested negative
for COVID-19 on 15 April for her on-arrival test, and again on 17 April
during quarantine.
While Case 62373 had not travelled to India with his parents, he had
requested to take care of his mother at the quarantine facility, and
moved into the same room as her on 16 April, where he had remained. On
23 April, he developed a blocked nose and reported his symptom. He was
conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases the next day,
and was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. His serological test
result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current
infection.
Case 62373 received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 26 February
and the second dose on 19 March. The COVID-19 vaccine is effective in
preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those
vaccinated, but it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get
infected. Further research is required to determine if the vaccination
will also prevent onward transmission of the infection. Our existing key
enablers – safe management measures, testing, and contact tracing –
continue to be necessary and effective in helping us to mitigate spread
and keep community transmission low.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 18
Amongst the 18 imported cases,
-   1 (Case 62371) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from
    India.

-   3 (Cases 62346, 62368 and 62372) are Dependant’s Pass holders who
    arrived from India and the Maldives.

-   3 (Cases 62342, 62343 and 62345) are Student's Pass holders who
    arrived from India.

-   1 (Case 62339) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from India.

-   6 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India,
    Myanmar and the Philippines, of whom 2 (Cases 62366 and 62369) are
    foreign domestic workers.

-   4 are Short-Term Visit Pass holders. Cases 62341, 62356 and 62361
    arrived from Croatia, Germany, Indonesia and Romania for work
    projects in Singapore. Case 62357 arrived from India to visit his
    family member who is a Singapore Permanent Resident.

They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.
4.     Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.     Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     16 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,629 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 88 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 219 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
