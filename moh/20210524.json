Our epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission among individuals who visited these malls. Our findings suggest that Case 62933<sup>[3]</sup>, a cleaner who works at Park Avenue Rochester, an SHN dedicated facility, may have been the source of infection of the JEM/ Westgate cluster as she had been at Westgate on 6 May 2021. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory have revealed that some of the visitors to JEM and Westgate have similar sequences to that of Case 62933. Further investigations into the mode of transmission are ongoing.<br></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To break any potential chain of transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, JEM and Westgate shopping malls have been closed to all members of the public starting from 23 May 2021 and will re-open 14 days later, on 6 June 2021. MOH has conducted special testing operations for staff who work at both premises. We have also offered free COVID-19 testing for members of the public who had visited JEM and Westgate from 10 May to 14 May. In view of the additional cases detected, free COVID-19 testing will be extended to all individuals who had visited JEM and Westgate from 10 May to 22 May.
