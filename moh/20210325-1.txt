4.       Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.       Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
6.       MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the Case 60102
cluster[1] for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the
cluster has now been closed. There are currently no open clusters of
infections.
7.       COVID-19 viral fragments were detected on 21 March from testing
of wastewater sample collected on 20 March from the UTown Residence
North Tower at the National University of Singapore. As a precautionary
measure, MOH carried out a special testing operations to test residents
of the affected apartments. In total, 438 individuals were swabbed, and
all the results have come back negative for COVID-19 infection. Our
investigations indicate that the COVID-19 viral fragments detected in
the wastewater sample were likely due to viral shedding from a recovered
past infection amongst the residents.
