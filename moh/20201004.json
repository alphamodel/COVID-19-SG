Case 57953 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread. Case 57961 was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic.<br><br>Epidemiological investigations of the cases are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to determine if they could have been infected by them.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased from an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 2 cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 1 case in the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>a)&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cases residing in dormitories: 4</strong></span></p> <h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">All 4 cases residing in dormitories were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories.
