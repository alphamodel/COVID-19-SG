Vaccination-differentiated Smms At Malls and Large Standalone Stores



VACCINATION-DIFFERENTIATED SMMS AT MALLS AND LARGE STANDALONE STORES


Published Date: 10 Oct 2021

1.  The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) yesterday announced an
expansion of Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS)
to protect unvaccinated individuals and reduce the strain on our
healthcare system. With effect from 13 October 2021, VDS must be
implemented for entry into shopping malls and large standalone stores¹.
This means that only fully vaccinated persons² will be allowed to enter
these premises.



2.  We are aware of concerns raised by the public with regard to the
need for some unvaccinated individuals to access medical and childcare
related services in the malls. Provisions will be made to allow for
access to these services.



3.  We would like to assure members of the public that the Ministry of
Trade and Industry (MTI) and Enterprise Singapore (ESG) are working
closely with mall operators to allow tenants, mall operators, and the
public to familiarise themselves with the new processes and checks. To
facilitate this, there will be a grace period of one week for VDS in
malls to be implemented, from 13 October 2021 to 19 October 2021. MTI
and ESG will provide more details in an advisory which will be issued
before 13 October 2021.



4.  We seek everyone’s support to observe safe management measures and
cooperate with the malls as they implement the VDS. This will help lower
transmission risks and slow down the pace of community infections in
this Stabilisation Phase.
