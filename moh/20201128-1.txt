CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
58412 is a Singaporean who is a stallholder selling mutton at Tekka
Market. She is asymptomatic, and was detected from our community
surveillance testing of stallholders in and around Tekka Centre on 26
November.
She was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases the next
day when her test result came back positive. Her serological test result
is also positive, which indicates likely past infection.
She works with a co-worker at her stall at Tekka Market, and stays at
Yishun Street 22 with her husband, who has been working at Mustafa
Centre for the past few years. She regularly visits her children who
stay at Bishan Street 13 and Tampines Street 86.
Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all her
identified close contacts, including her family members and co-worker,
have been isolated and placed on quarantine and will be tested at the
start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests on her
household and family contacts to determine if she could have been
infected by them.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 5
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 4 are currently employed in Singapore. Of
these, 2 (Cases 58410 and 58414) are Work Pass holders who arrived from
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and 2 (Cases 58413 and 58415) are Work Permit
holders who arrived from Malaysia and Indonesia. The remaining case
(Case 58411) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from Saudi Arabia.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
