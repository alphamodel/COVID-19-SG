4. There are 3 cases who have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection, all of whom were unvaccinated against COVID-19. Of
these, 2 (Cases 68636 and 68664) were non-ambulatory and had limited
movement outside of their homes, but yet had been infected as unlinked
cases.
5. Case 67918, an 80 year-old male Singaporean, has passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection on 26 August 2021. He tested
positive for COVID-19 infection on 7 August and was admitted to Ng Teng

conditions.

complications due to COVID-19 infection on 27 August 2021. She had been

condition on 11 August and tested negative for COVID-19 upon admission.
Another test taken on 17 August came back positive for COVID-19
infection. She had a history of diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart

9. There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 9.2%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 1.3%.
