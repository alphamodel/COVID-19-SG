UPDATE ON LOCAL COVID-19 SITUATION (5 NOV 2021)


Published Date: 05 Nov 2021

SUMMARY OF LOCAL SITUATION



·  1,669 cases remain warded in hospital. 282 cases require oxygen
supplementation in the general ward, 70 are unstable and under close
monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 70 are critically ill
and intubated in the ICU. The current overall ICU utilisation rate is
68.6%.



·  Over the last 28 days, of the 92,147 infected individuals, 98.7%
had no or mild symptoms, 0.7% required oxygen supplementation in the
general ward, 0.3% were in the ICU, and 0.2% has died.



·  As of 4 November 2021, 85% of our population has completed their
full regimen/ received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, 85% has received
at least one dose, and 17% has received boosters.



·  Over the past day, 3,657 cases were discharged, of whom 528 are
seniors aged 60 years and above. 1,767 new cases of COVID-19 infection
were detected, with 1,639 in the community, 120 in the migrant worker
dormitories and 8 imported cases. The weekly infection growth rate is
0.81.



·  The fall in the number of cases today is likely due to fewer
swabs being done over the Deepavali Public Holiday at Public Health
Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and polyclinics. We remind those who feel
unwell with acute respiratory infection symptoms not to delay seeking
medical attention and getting tested. 8 Regional Screening Centres and 3
Quick Test Centres, offering free confirmatory polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) tests, are open on Saturdays and Sundays¹.
