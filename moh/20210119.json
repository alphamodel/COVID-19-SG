He was identified as a close contact of Case 59365 on 16 January, and was placed on quarantine.</p><p>He was swabbed on the same day and his result came back negative for COVID-19. &nbsp;There is therefore no risk of transmission to the students he had contact with previously.&nbsp;However he developed a fever on 17 January while he was in quarantine, and was tested again at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital. This time, his test came back positive for COVID-19 infection.

His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.</p><p>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family and household members, as well as co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.</p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong></p><p>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Imported cases: 26</strong></p><p>Amongst the 26 imported cases,</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 (Cases 59408, 59427, 59430 and 59433) are Singaporeans and 3 (Cases 59426, 59431 and 59432) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from Indonesia, Ireland, Myanmar and UK.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 (Cases 59412 and 59422) are Student\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from Bulgaria and Malaysia.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 (Case 59416) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from the UAE.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and Indonesia, of whom 3 (Cases 59421, 59424 and 59425) are foreign domestic workers.</p><p>They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.</p><p>Case 59415 is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Bangladesh on 28 December 2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 11 January 2021. His swab done on 8 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19, and subsequent tests on 12 January and 14 January were also negative. His test on 17 January came back positive for COVID-19 infection, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load. His serological test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.</p><p>Case 59433 is a 28 year-old female Singaporean who returned from Ireland on 3 January, and was placed on SHN at a dedicated facility. Her swab done on 14 January during SHN was negative for COVID- 19. She developed a dry throat later that day, and cough on 16 January but did not report her symptoms. Her SHN ended on 17 January, and on 18 January, she sought medical treatment at the National University Hospital where she was tested for COVID-19.
