515 MORE CASES DISCHARGED; 246 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 30 Jun 2020

  As of 30 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 246 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

A)  IMPORTED CASES: 1 (1 Permanent Resident)

There is an imported case today involving a Singapore Permanent Resident
who had returned to Singapore from India on 24 June 2020. She was placed
on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore, and had been conveyed in
a dedicated transport to an SHN facility to commence her 14-day
isolation. She developed symptoms during SHN.

B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 5[1]  (2 Singaporeans, 3 Work
Permit holders)

Of the 5 cases in the community, 4 had been picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening.

Amongst the 2 Singaporean cases, 1 (Case 43712) was detected due to our
proactive surveillance of persons deployed to frontline COVID-19
operations, even though he is asymptomatic. Epidemiological
investigations are ongoing for the remaining case (Case 43703).

Amongst the 3 Work Permit holders, 2 (Cases 43890 and 43891) had been
swabbed as part of our proactive screening of workers in essential
services. The remaining case (Case 43711) is asymptomatic, and had been
tested as he works in frontline COVID-19 operations.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections.[2] The serological test results for Cases 43711 and
43712 have come back positive, which indicate likely past infections.
The test results for the remaining cases are pending.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 4 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 240

We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please

3.  Of the new cases, 98% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

4.  In the past week (23 June to 29 June), MOH has uncovered
links for 3 previously unlinked cases.

5.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.

from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 38,500 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 5,166 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 26 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.



MINISTRY OF HEALTH
30 JUNE 2020

[1]  Updated from the afternoon press release as one case has been
classified as imported following contact tracing.
[2]  Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a
past infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
