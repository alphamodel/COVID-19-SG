CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2
There are 2 cases in the community today who are currently unlinked.
Case 59028
Case 59028, a 24 year-old male Korean national, is a Work Permit holder
who works at Azur at Crowne Plaza Changi Airport (75 Airport Boulevard).
His job entails delivering pre-packed meals to air crew and hotel
guests. He does not interact with diners at Azur.
He tested positive for a pooled swab during Rostered Routine Testing
(RRT) on 2 January, and was tested again on 4 January. On the same day,
he started to develop acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. His
individual test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 5
January, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. His serological test result has come back negative,
indicating that this is likely a current infection. He has also tested
preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further
confirmatory tests.
Case 59034
Case 59034 is a 31 year-old male Filipino who arrived from the
Philippines on 4 December, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until
18 December. His pre-departure test taken in the Philippines on 1
December was negative for COVID-19 infection, and his test on 14
December during SHN came back negative as well.
He is a Work Permit holder who is employed by Singapore General Hospital
(SGH), but has not started work yet. As part of his pre-employment
health screening, he was tested for COVID-19 on 5 January even though he
is asymptomatic, and his test came back positive. He was subsequently
conveyed to SGH in an ambulance. His serological test result has come
back positive, which indicates a likely past infection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
