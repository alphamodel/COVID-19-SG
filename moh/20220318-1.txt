Extension of the Suspension of In-person Visits to Hospitals and
Residential Care Homes



EXTENSION OF THE SUSPENSION OF IN-PERSON VISITS TO HOSPITALS AND RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES


Published Date: 18 Mar 2022

The Ministry of Health (MOH) will continue to suspend in-person visits
to all hospital wards  and residential care homes¹ (‘Homes’) until 3
April 2022 (inclusive).
2. MOH had earlier announced the suspension of in-person visits to
hospitals and Homes until 20 March 2022 (inclusive). While the daily
number of local COVID-19 cases has fallen gradually over the past week,
our hospitals continue to face a high volume of patients and our
healthcare workers are still under significant stress. As such, to
relieve pressure on our hospital staff, and our nursing home staff who
are caring for COVID-positive residents on-site, in-person visits to
hospital wards and Homes will continue to be suspended until 3 April
2022 (inclusive).
3. Hospitals and Homes have the discretion to allow visits for
exceptional cases (e.g. if patient or resident is critically ill) and
such visitors will continue to be subject to prevailing visitor
management measures (see Annex for details). To help patients and
residents remain connected with their loved ones with the extended
suspension, hospitals and Homes will continue to support alternative
methods of communication such as through telephone or video calls.
4. We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients/residents, and
their family members and loved ones. MOH will review and calibrate these
measures as the situation evolves.

hospitals.
