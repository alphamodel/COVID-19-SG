Most of these patients did not require emergency care, and such unnecessary visits to the EDs risk compromising the standard of care for other patients who genuinely require emergency medical care.&nbsp;<br><br>2. &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;\">The Children\u2019s Emergency (CE) departments at KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s&nbsp;Hospital and National University Hospital have experienced very high attendances&nbsp;over the past two weeks. This week, there were on average more than 650 cases per day across both CEs, up from an average of 450 cases per day in early January. Approximately 80%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the patients, including those with COVID-19 infections, presented with mild symptoms, did not require hospitalisation, and were discharged after their ED visits. Amongst paediatric patients who were admitted, most did not stay long in hospital, and were discharged on average within two to three days. The proportion of severe COVID-19 infections and Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) remains low, at less than 1 out of 1,000 paediatric cases.&nbsp;<br><br>3. &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;\">We advise the public to seek medical treatment at a hospital\u2019s ED only for serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness and uncontrollable bleeding. This allows those with severe illness in need of emergency care to be attended to quickly. It also helps to preserve our hospital capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care.&nbsp;<br><br>4. &nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">We urge members of the public, including children, to visit their General Practitioners (GP) or a 24-hour clinic for non-emergencies. If COVID-19 testing or review for symptoms of acute respiratory infection is needed, they can visit&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.phpc.gov.sg/\" style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Public Health Preparedness Clinics</a><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;(PHPC) for further assessment.
