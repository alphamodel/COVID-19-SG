We have since completed investigation into these 13 cases and determined that there was no further transmission beyond them. The other COVID-19 cases who had served SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore were determined to be unlinked to the 13 cases. All the hotel staff tested under our special testing operations tested negative for COVID-19 infection using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The serological tests of 11 staff are positive, indicating likely past infections. These findings indicate that there is no ongoing transmission at Mandarin Orchard Singapore. </p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view that the premises have been thoroughly disinfected, and there is no longer risk of transmission to hotel guests, MOH has approved the re-opening of Mandarin Orchard Singapore from 2 January 2021 (14 days after its closure on 19 December), including its restaurant and event spaces. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong></p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
