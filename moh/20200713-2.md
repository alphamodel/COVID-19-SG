    <body><h1> 322 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 13 Jul 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 13 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 322 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there are 11 cases in the community, of whom 2 are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents and 9 are Work Pass holders. In addition, there are 5 imported cases who had been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The higher number of cases today is mainly due to fewer tests being conducted by the COVID-19 testing laboratories over the public holiday and weekend on 10 July and 11 July, with the backlog of samples being cleared from 12 July. The number of cases reported for 9 July and before were not affected.</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.</p></body>
