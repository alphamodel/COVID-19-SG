who had arrived in Singapore before the implementation of border
measures. He had been segregated from the general inmate population
since his admission to Changi Prison Complex on 6 June, and was tested
positive for COVID-19. There are no Singaporean/ Permanent Resident
cases.

further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
