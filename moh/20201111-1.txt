CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
Update on Case 58262: The serological test result for Case 58262 has
come back positive, which indicates likely past infection. Prior to
this, he had been tested twice using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
test. His first test on 3 November was inconclusive, and the second test
on 9 November yielded a very high CT value, which is indicative of a low
viral load. He works as a cleaner at an office building at PaxOcean
Singapore Pte Ltd shipyard (33 Tuas Crescent), which is connected to a
previous case (Case 58216), but there are no indications that they had
interacted.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 18
Amongst the 18 imported cases, 2 (Cases 58269 and 58270) are Singapore
Permanent Residents who returned from India and Indonesia. Another 14
are currently employed in Singapore. Of these, 4 (Cases 58263, 58266,
58267 and 58268) are Work Pass holders who arrived from Myanmar, the
Netherlands and Switzerland, and 10 (Cases 58265, 58271, 58273, 58274,
58275, 58276, 58277, 58278, 58279 and 58280) are Work Permit holders
employed as foreign domestic workers who arrived from Myanmar and
Indonesia. The remaining cases are a Dependant’s Pass holder (Case
58272) who arrived from Nepal, and a Special Pass holder (Case 58264)
who arrived from Russia to board a ship docked here as a crew member.

3.   Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     5 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,990 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.       There are currently 33 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 40 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
