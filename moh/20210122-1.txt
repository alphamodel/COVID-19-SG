CASE DETAILS
A)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
Case 59522 is a 26 year-old female Malaysian national who works as a
sales personnel at BS Industrial & Construction Supply Pte Ltd (34
Kallang Place). She is a co-worker of Case 59429 [1]
She was placed on quarantine on 18 January when Case 59429 was confirmed
to have COVID-19 infection. On 20 January, she was tested for COVID-19
even though she is asymptomatic. Her test came back positive the next
day, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases
(NCID). Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that
this is likely a current infection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including her family members, as
well as co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and
will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that
we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests
for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected
by them.
