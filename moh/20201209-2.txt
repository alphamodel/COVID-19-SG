No New Cases of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection



NO NEW CASES OF LOCALLY TRANSMITTED COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 09 Dec 2020

As of 9 December 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed that there are no new cases of locally
transmitted COVID-19 infection.
There are 6 imported cases, who had already been placed on Stay-Home
Notice upon arrival in Singapore.
We are still working through the details of the cases, and further
updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued
tonight.
An 83 year-old male Singaporean on board Royal Caribbean Internationalâ€™s
_Quantum of the Seas_ tested positive for COVID-19 infection this
morning, and was immediately isolated. He had reported to the medical
centre with diarrhoea, and as part of the protocols was tested for
COVID-19 using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test equipment on
board the ship. His sample will be re-tested at the National Public
Health Laboratory, and a second sample will be taken for confirmatory
tests. If further tests also come back positive for COVID-19 infection,
he will be included as a case in our daily case count.
Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been
isolated, and the results that have come back so far are negative for
COVID-19 infection. The remaining passengers and crew will remain on
board the ship until contact tracing is completed. All passengers will
undergo mandatory COVID-19 testing before they are allowed to leave the
terminal at Marina Bay Cruise Centre.
