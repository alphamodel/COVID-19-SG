        As of 28 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 359 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 2 (1 WORK PASS HOLDER, 1 DEPENDANT’S PASS HOLDER)
Both imported cases arrived in Singapore from India on 12 July and 13
July. Case 51007 is a Work Pass holder who is currently employed in
Singapore, and Case 50946 is a Dependant’s Pass holder. Both of them had
been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore,
and had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 WORK PASS HOLDER)
There is 1 case in the community today. Case 50919 had been identified
as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and had been placed on
quarantine earlier. He was tested during quarantine to determine his
status, even though he is asymptomatic.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 10 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 2 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 356
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
