4.    Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.    Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
6.    MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the MT ALLI
cluster for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster
has now been closed.

hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 61,702 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or

Of these, most are stable or improving, and 2 are in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 296 are isolated and cared for at community

well but still test positive for COVID-19. 34 have passed away from
