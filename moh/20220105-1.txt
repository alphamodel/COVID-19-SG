Expert Committee On Covid-19 Vaccination Recommends Booster Vaccination
At No Later Than Nine Months



EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION RECOMMENDS BOOSTER VACCINATION AT NO LATER THAN NINE MONTHS


Published Date: 05 Jan 2022

      The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) recommends
that all vaccinated persons aged 18 years and above should receive a
booster vaccine dose at about five months after the last dose of their
primary vaccine course, or as soon as possible thereafter, in order to
maintain good protection against COVID-19. This booster dose should not
be delayed beyond nine months after the primary vaccine course.



2.  Local and international data show reduced vaccine
protection against COVID-19 infection from around six months after
completion of the last vaccine dose in the primary vaccination series or
earlier. The level of protection drops even further over time. There is
also some reduction in protection against severe disease, particularly
in older persons. In addition, international studies have shown that the
protection against Omicron variant infection by a primary vaccination
series is weaker compared to previous variants, and that boosters
increase the protection against infection and severe illnesses caused by
Omicron. As such, BOOSTER VACCINATION IS CRUCIAL to ensure continued
protection against COVID-19.



BOOSTER RECOMMENDATION FOR PERSONS VACCINATED WITH THE MRNA VACCINES



3.  EC19V therefore recommends that those aged 18 years and
above who have completed a primary course comprising two doses of either
the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should
receive a booster dose of either mRNA vaccine around five months after
the second dose, or as soon as possible thereafter. This booster dose
should not be delayed beyond nine months after the primary vaccine
course.



BOOSTER RECOMMENDATION FOR PERSONS VACCINATED WITH THE SINOVAC-CORONAVAC
AND SINOPHARM VACCINES



4.  Persons who had received two or more doses of the
Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccines as part of a three-dose primary
vaccination series are strongly recommended to receive ONE DOSE OF AN
MRNA VACCINE AS A BOOSTER DOSE. Such persons who received an mRNA
vaccine as their third dose should do so around FIVE MONTHS THEREAFTER.
However, those who received the Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccine
as their third vaccine dose should do so at THREE MONTHS THEREAFTER, due
to lower antibody levels generated by the third vaccine dose.



BOOSTER RECOMMENDATION FOR NON-MRNA VACCINES



5.  Individuals who have received recognised primary
vaccination regimens other than the vaccines mentioned above are also
recommended to receive a booster dose around five months, or as soon as
possible thereafter. This includes persons who had completed the primary
series vaccination with other WHO EUL vaccines.

BOOSTER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RECOVERED PERSONS AND PERSONS WITH MEDICAL
CONDITIONS REQUIRING AN ENHANCED PRIMARY SERIES OF THREE MRNA VACCINE
DOSES



6.  Persons with medical conditions such as moderate or
severe immunocompromise, and who have received an enhanced primary
series of three doses of an mRNA vaccine, are recommended to receive a
booster dose (i.e. fourth dose) of an mRNA vaccine around five months
after the third dose.



7.  Persons who have recovered from COVID-19, and who were
unvaccinated or partially vaccinated before their infection should
receive one dose of the mRNA vaccine at least three months after
infection to reduce their risk of reinfection. There is no change from
previous recommendations for this group. No subsequent doses of
vaccination are recommended at this time, but recommendations may be
updated, as more data become available.



8.  Persons who were fully vaccinated with two doses of mRNA
vaccine and are not immunocompromised, who subsequently were infected
with COVID-19 and recovered, also do not require an additional booster
dose at this time.  There is no change from previous recommendations for
this group.



9.  The Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine should only be considered
as a booster vaccine in persons who are medically ineligible to receive
mRNA vaccines. All other persons should be boosted with the mRNA
vaccines.



10.  Timely booster vaccination will ensure optimal protection
against COVID-19, including the Omicron variant. EC19V urges all persons
aged 18 years and above to receive their booster vaccination as soon as
they are eligible to do so.
