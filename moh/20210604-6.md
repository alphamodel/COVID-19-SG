    <body><h1>Joint Moh-moe Statement On Erroneous Administration of Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine to 16 Year-old Youth</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 04 Jun 2021</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On 3 June 2021, a 16 year-old youth was administered the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine<sup>[1]</sup> at Kolam Ayer Community Club Vaccination Centre. The error was discovered onsite when vaccination centre staff identified that the individual was under 18 years of age during the post-vaccination observation period. As an additional precaution, he was placed under a longer observation time of 50 minutes, and remains generally well. </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;">2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our investigations found that the individual’s date of birth had been erroneously entered when booking a vaccination appointment after receiving the sign-up link. This resulted in his age being incorrectly registered as above 18 years of age, making it possible for a Moderna vaccination centre to be selected. The vaccination centre staff had failed to verify his age during registration, which should have been carried out. </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The safety of those receiving the vaccination is of utmost priority. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Education (MOE) take a serious view of this incident. We apologise for the inconvenience and anxiety caused, and have reached out to the youth’s parents to explain the situation. The Expert Committee for COVID-19 Vaccination has reviewed this case, and does not expect him to suffer any safety issues from this incident.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A thorough review of our internal processes at vaccination sites has been carried out by MOH to prevent a recurrence. This includes strengthening our online registration process to ensure individuals make appointments at suitable vaccination centres based on their eligibility, as well as putting in place more stringent protocols at our vaccination sites to verify eligibility. We are in close contact with the individual and his family, and will continue to monitor his health closely and provide the necessary support.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><br>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong></strong><strong>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION<br></strong><strong></strong><strong>4 JUNE 2021</strong></span></p><div> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"> <div id="ftn1"> <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><sup>[1] </sup>The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is currently authorised for use in individuals aged 18 and above. </span></p> </div> </div></body>
