2. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from
5 cases in the week before, to 2 in the past week. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at 2 cases a week in
the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as
well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 2
There are 2 cases residing in dormitories today, of whom 1 was detected
from our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic. This allows us to pick up
cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to
ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively
containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts. The other was
tested for COVID-19 when he developed acute respiratory infection (ARI)
symptoms.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 3
Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 58140) is a Singapore Permanent
Resident who returned from the UK, and another (Case 58142) is a
Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from the UAE. The remaining case
(Case 58143) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
Indonesia. She was allowed entry into Singapore to visit her child who
is a Singapore Permanent Resident. They had all been placed on SHN upon
arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.
3. Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
4. Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
5. MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at
North Coast Lodge (51 North Coast Avenue) for the past two incubation
periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
6. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7. 14 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,858 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8. There are currently 51 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of
these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care
unit. 33 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are
those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
