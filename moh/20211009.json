We have used this time to do several things. We have built up COVID-19 Treatment Facilities to complement our hospital and community care facilities. We have also bolstered manpower, employed technology, and streamlined processes for the Home Recovery Programme (HRP), which allows the majority of individuals with mild or no symptoms to recover safely in their own homes.</span><br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">2.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">We thank all Singapore residents for reducing their level of activity and social interactions in the past two weeks. Your efforts have helped to slow down the rise in daily cases. However, the present wave of infection has not crested, and we must be prepared for cases to continue to increase and remain high for some time.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">3.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">We will ride this wave while ensuring that our healthcare system is not overwhelmed. Most vaccinated persons who catch the virus have only mild or no symptoms. Children aged 12 and below generally have mild or no symptoms as well, even though they are unvaccinated. However, for seniors who are unvaccinated, they are at great risk of falling very sick if infected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this group accounts for 1.5% of our population, they account for two-thirds of the individuals who need ICU care or have died.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">4.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">We will therefore need to expand our vaccination-differentiated safe management measures to protect the unvaccinated. We will also simplify our testing protocols to make these easier to understand and adhere to. We will extend booster vaccinations to healthcare and frontline workers, and persons in institutionalised settings, followed by all individuals aged 30 and above, to ensure continued high levels of COVID-19 immunity in the population.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Updates on Local COVID-19 Situation</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">5.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">The vast majority (98.8%) of cases continue to have mild or no symptoms. This is due to our high vaccination coverage, with 83% of the population having now completed their 2-dose regimen. Of the 423 cases with severe illness in the last two weeks, a disproportionate proportion (53.9%) were unvaccinated, and the rest were vaccinated individuals with co-morbidities.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">6.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">The number of persons requiring ICU is continuing to rise at the same rate as our overall case numbers, albeit with a lag. We have had 51 new cases in ICU over the past two weeks, as compared to 32 over the preceding two weeks. Although we have increased our hospital capacity, bed occupancy rates are rising, and our healthcare manpower has been stretched.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Home Recovery Programme</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><u><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Extending the enrolment criteria</span></u></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">7.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">Since the start of the HRP on 15 September 2021, more than 19,000 individuals have been recovering at home, of which more than 8,000 have fully recovered and been discharged.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">As our population has become more familiar with the HRP, and our healthcare professionals have become more experienced in handling the medical needs of those on HRP, it is timely to extend the HRP to a wider range of individuals, especially for those with mild or no symptoms. This will allow us to better prioritise healthcare resources in our hospitals to take care of the severely ill or vulnerable patients, without compromising care to those who may be younger with milder or no symptoms.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">8.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">We will extend home recovery to unvaccinated persons aged 12 to 49 years as the severity of illness for such younger and unvaccinated individuals is low, and it is safe for them to recover at home.&nbsp;Given the clinical observations to-date of vaccinated infected persons aged 70 to 79 years, and the fall risks associated with such elderly persons in an unfamiliar environment, it will also be safer for them to recover in the familiar surroundings of their home<sup>1</sup></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">. However, as a precaution, individuals from both groups would be assigned to a healthcare provider and should monitor their health closely, including their oxygen level, during the isolation period and consult the healthcare provider early should there be any significant deterioration in their health.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">9.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">We will also extend default home recovery to children aged 5 to 11 years old, as we found that COVID-19 is not a serious illness for the vast majority of them. Furthermore, parents have often requested that children be allowed to recover at home, where there are caregivers from the family.&nbsp; As for children aged 1 to 4, we will continue to extend home recovery to them provided that they are first clinically assessed at the hospitals to be suitable for home recovery.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">10.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">The combined outcome of these changes is that&nbsp;<strong>from 10 October 2021, we will make HRP<sup>2</sup></strong></span><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&nbsp;the default care arrangement for everyone, other than for the following<u>&nbsp;persons</u>:</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><br></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">a) partially or unvaccinated individuals aged 50 years and older;</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">b) vaccinated persons 80 years and older; and</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">c) children aged less than 1 year, and children aged 1 to 4 years who have been assessed to be clinically unsuitable for home recovery.</span></strong></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">Please refer to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-a-(5).pdf?sfvrsn=616a12c0_0\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Annex A</span></a>&nbsp;</span>for more details.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">11.<span style=\"font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">Individuals who are on HRP will continue to have 24/7 access to medical support.
