Her swab done on 16 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19. She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 23 January in preparation for her return to the UK. Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Her Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and her serology test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported based on her travel history. She is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/moh-press-release---annex-a-and-b-(25-jan-2021).pdf?sfvrsn=5c7e7e28_0\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
