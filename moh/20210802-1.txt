CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     602 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 36 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 7 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU). 4 amongst these 43 cases are fully
vaccinated. Of these, 3 require oxygen supplementation while 1 requires
ICU care as they have underlying medical conditions. 31 seniors above 60
years, of whom 28 are completely unvaccinated or partially vaccinated,
have fallen very ill.
6.     Imported Case 67264, a 34 year-old male Ukraine national, has
passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 1 August
2021. He was a sea crew who arrived in Singapore on board a vessel on 29
July. He had developed a fever, cough and lethargy on 25 July, and
subsequently breathlessness on 31 July. He was conveyed from the vessel
to Singapore General Hospital on 1 August, and was confirmed to have
COVID-19 infection on the same day. In total, 38 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES
8.      Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased
from 1,021 cases in the week before to 835 cases in the past week. We
are likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as
we step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the
community. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased
from 133 cases in the week before to 276 cases in the past week. The
7-day moving average number of all linked community cases and all
unlinked community cases are 79.9 and 39.4 respectively.
