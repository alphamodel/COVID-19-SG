Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from 5 cases in the week before, to 2 in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at 2 cases a week in the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>Case Details\n</strong><br>\n<br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 0\n</strong><br>\n<br>There are no cases in the community today.&nbsp; \n<br>\n<br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 2\n</strong><br>\n<br>There are 2 cases residing in dormitories today, of whom 1 was detected from our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts. The other was tested for COVID-19 when he developed acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. \n<br>\n<br><strong>c) Imported cases: 3\n</strong><br>\n<br>Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 58140) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from the UK, and another (Case 58142) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from the UAE. The remaining case (Case 58143) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Indonesia. She was allowed entry into Singapore to visit her child who is a Singapore Permanent Resident. They had all been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.\n<br>\n<br>3. Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).\n<br>\n<br>4. Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them. \n<br>\n<br>5. MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at North Coast Lodge (51 North Coast Avenue) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.\n<br>\n<br><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong>\n<br>\n<br>6. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

In all, 57,858 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities. \n<br>\n<br>8. There are currently 51 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 33 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection. \n<br>\n<br>\n<strong><br>MINISTRY OF HEALTH\n<br>25 OCTOBER 2020</strong>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "2-new-cases-of-locally-transmitted-covid-19-infection-25Oct-update", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "Temporary Cessation of Use of Two Influenza Vaccines", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1603630800000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "25 Oct 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Ministry of Health (MOH) is advising that use of two influenza vaccines \u2013 SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra \u2013 should be temporarily ceased. This is a precautionary measure following reported deaths after influenza vaccination in South Korea. No deaths associated with influenza vaccination have been reported in Singapore to date. MOH and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) are monitoring the situation closely.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HSA is in touch with the South Korean authorities for further information as they investigate to determine if the deaths are related to influenza vaccinations. Based on information released by the South Korean health authorities, seven brands of influenza vaccines were administered to the individuals involved in the deaths reported in South Korea. Of the seven brands, two are available in Singapore. They are SKYCellflu Quadrivalent, manufactured by SK Bioscience and locally distributed by AJ Biologics, and VaxigripTetra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur and locally distributed by Sanofi Aventis.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a precautionary measure while HSA is assessing the implications of the reported deaths in South Korea, MOH has informed healthcare providers and medical practitioners to temporarily stop the use of these two vaccines. Healthcare providers and medical practitioners may continue to use the two other influenza vaccines that have been brought into Singapore for the Northern Hemisphere 2020/21 influenza season. MOH and HSA will assess the situation as more information becomes available and further advise on the use of the affected vaccines.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Persons recommended to receive the influenza vaccination, including those recommended under the National Childhood Immunisation Schedule (NCIS) and National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), may continue to receive their influenza vaccination using other brands of influenza vaccines. Influenza vaccination provides protection against seasonal influenza viruses, and is effective in reducing the risk of complications and deaths due to influenza. This is especially so for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, the young, pregnant women and those with certain pre-existing medical conditions.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Influenza vaccination is generally safe and well tolerated. Like any medicines, vaccines can cause side effects. Common side effects from influenza vaccination may include soreness and redness at the injection site, fever, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue and nausea. These side effects are generally mild and resolve on their own. In rare instances, a person may experience high fever or severe allergic reactions (such as breathing difficulty, wheezing and swelling around the eyes) and immediate medical attention should be sought.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Vaccines approved for use in Singapore have been evaluated by HSA to ensure that they meet the required international standards of quality, safety and efficacy. To ensure that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks, HSA monitors the safety of vaccines through an adverse event monitoring system. It draws on the network of local healthcare professionals and international regulatory counterparts to pick up adverse events suspected to be associated with the vaccines.&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MOH and HSA will continue to monitor the situation closely for any concerns related to influenza vaccination and keep members of the public updated on new developments.&nbsp;</span></span></p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;<br>HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY<br>25 OCTOBER 2020</strong></span></span><br></div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "temporary-cessation-of-use-of-two-influenza-vaccines", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "2 New Cases of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1603615320000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "25 Oct 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "1.
