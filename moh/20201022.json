This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>c)&nbsp; &nbsp; Imported cases: 7<br></strong>&nbsp;<br>Amongst the 7 imported cases, 1 (Case 58101) is a Singaporean and another (Case 58111) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from Indonesia and India respectively. Another 2 are Work Pass (Case 58102) and Work Permit (Case 58103) holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from the UAE and Myanmar respectively. The remaining cases are Short-Term Visit Pass holders. Cases 58106 and 58110 are family members of Singapore Permanent Residents, while Case 58107 was allowed entry into Singapore as he was already receiving medical care in Singapore and had returned for further treatment. They had all been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.<br>&nbsp;<br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
