5.     MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection
amongst individuals who work in or visited ComfortDelGro Driving Centre
(205 Ubi Avenue 4). There are so far 6 cases linked to the cluster. To
break the chain of transmission and enable deep cleaning of the
premises, ComfortDelGro Driving Centre has been closed to all members of
the public from 15 July to 29 July 2021.

2021. Please refer to https://go.gov.sg/cdc-testing for details on the

Closure of Las Vegas KTV and Tuberose KTV
7.      MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst social
hostesses who had frequented KTV lounges or clubs currently operating as
F&B outlets, and their close social contacts. Our epidemiological
investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission
at Las Vegas KTV (35 Selegie Road) and Tuberose KTV (35 Selegie Road).
8.      To break any potential chain of transmission and enable deep
cleaning, these premises will be closed to all members of the public
from 16 July to 30 July 2021. We will also extend free COVID-19 testing
to members of the public who had:
         i)   Visited the following premises between 29 June and 15 July
2021:
               -  Las Vegas KTV (35 Selegie Road) or Tuberose KTV (35

9.      All visitors to ComfortDelGro Driving Centre, as well as Las
Vegas KTV and Tuberose KTV and similar settings,and those who had
interacted with social hostesses of any nationality, are advised to
