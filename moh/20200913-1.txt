A) IMPORTED CASES: 8 (1 Singaporean, 1 Permanent Resident, 4 Work Permit
holders, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders)
Amongst the 8 imported cases, 1 (Case 57513) is a Singaporean and 1
(Case 57542) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned to Singapore
from India on 5 September and 10 September. Another 4 (Cases 57497,
57525, 57526 and 57527) are Work Permit holders currently employed in
Singapore who arrived from the Philippines on 30 August. The remaining
cases (Case 57533 and 57537) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived
from India and the US on 30 August.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Work Permit holder)
There is a case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
57520 was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of
workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living
outside the dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 40
Amongst the 40 cases residing in dormitories, 31 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 9 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past
infections. [1] The serological test results for 14 cases have come back
positive so far, which indicate likely past infection.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     Of the new cases, 90% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     65 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 56,764 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.    There are currently 60 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 555 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.

==
[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
