Case 58973 is a ship crew who had boarded a vessel on 1 November 2020 in
Indonesia. On 31 December, he was placed on quarantine as he had been
identified as a close contact of a previously reported case (Case 58812)
who is a crew member of the same vessel. Case 58973 was conveyed to a
government quarantine facility on 2 January, and tested positive for
COVID-19 infection on 3 January. Prior to that, he had not disembarked
from the vessel. All the remaining crew members of the vessel have been
placed on quarantine since 31 December.
3.    Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
