COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE TESTING

5.  MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst
Vietnamese social hostesses who had frequented KTV lounges or clubs
currently operating as F&B outlets, and their close social contacts. To
quickly uncover any community infection cases, we will be conducting
special testing operations for all staff of Supreme KTV (Far East
Shopping Centre), Empress KTV (Tanglin Shopping Centre) and Club Dolce
(Balestier Point).

6.  We will also extend free COVID-19 testing to members of the
public who had:

i)  Visited the following premises between 29 June and 12 July
2021:
•  Supreme KTV (Far East Shopping Centre), Empress KTV (Tanglin
Shopping Centre) or Club Dolce (Balestier Point); or
•  Similar KTV lounges or clubs operating as F&B outlets.

ii)  Interacted with Vietnamese social hostesses in any setting
between 29 June and 12 July 2021.

Please refer to https://go.gov.sg/ktv-testing for details on the testing
operations.

7.  All visitors to these premises and similar settings and those
who had interacted with Vietnamese social hostesses are advised to
monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as
possible, for 14 days from their date of visit or interaction. They are
encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.



CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

8.  80 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 6 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 2 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU).

9.  There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to
prevent serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days,
22 local cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or
passed away. 18 are unvaccinated, 4 are partially vaccinated and none
was fully vaccinated.
