Published Date: 24 Jul 2021

As of 24 July 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and
verified that there are 127 cases of locally transmitted COVID-19
infection, of which 75 are linked to the Jurong Fishery Port cluster and
5 belong to the KTV cluster. Of the 127 cases today, 69 are linked to
previous cases, and have already been placed on quarantine. 29 are
linked to previous cases and were detected through surveillance. 29 are
currently unlinked. Amongst the cases are 6 seniors above 70 years who
are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, and are at risk of serious
illness.
2. There are 3 imported cases, who have already been placed on Stay-Home
Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. 1 was detected upon
arrival in Singapore, while 2 developed the illness during SHN or
isolation.
3. In total, there are 130 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore
today.

CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
4. 490 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and under
observation. There are currently 12 cases of serious illness requiring
oxygen supplementation, and 1 in critical condition in the intensive
care unit (ICU). None amongst these 13 cases is fully vaccinated. 9
seniors above 60 years, who are completely unvaccinated or partially
vaccinated, have fallen very ill.
5. Case 64342, an 83 year-old female Singaporean, has passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection on 24 July 2021. She resided at
Bukit Merah View, and was linked to the 121 Bukit Merah View cluster.
She developed symptoms on 16 June but did not seek medical attention
until she was conveyed to National University Hospital on 18 June. She
had not been vaccinated against COVID-19, and had a history of
hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. In total, 37 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.

6. There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 11 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 6 are unvaccinated, 5 are partially vaccinated and none was fully
vaccinated.

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES
7. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased from
238 cases in the week before to 1,027 cases in the past week. We are
likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as we
step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the community.
The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from 17
cases in the week before to 120 cases in the past week. The 7-day moving
average number of all linked community cases and all unlinked community
cases are 129.6 and 17.1 respectively.

ACTIVE CLUSTERS UNDER MONITORING
9. There are 2 new clusters today. In total, there are currently 26
active clusters, ranging between 3 and 741 infections. MOH has been
monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have
been no more cases linked to the Case 64184 and Case 64264 clusters for
the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now
been closed.

Closure of Samy’s Curry Restaurant
10. MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
individuals who visited Samy’s Curry Restaurant (25 Dempsey Road). To
date, we have detected 8 cases linked to the cluster, and our
epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing
transmission at the restaurant. To break the chain of transmission and
enable deep cleaning of the premises, Samy’s Curry Restaurant will be
closed to all members of the public from 25 July to 8 August 2021.
11. All individuals who work in the restaurant have been placed on
quarantine, and will be tested during quarantine. To quickly uncover any
community infection cases, we will also extend free COVID-19 testing to
members of the public who had visited Samy’s Curry Restaurant between 19
July and 23 July 2021. Please refer to
https://go.gov.sg/samy-testing for details on the testing operations.
12. All visitors to the Dempsey area are advised to monitor their health
closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for 14
days from their date of visit or interaction. They are encouraged to see
a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.
PROGRESS OF NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAMME
