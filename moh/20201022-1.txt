decreased from 4 cases in the week before, to 2 in the past week. The

CASE DETAILS
A)    CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0

There are no cases in the community today.

B)    CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1

There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today who was detected through
our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories.
This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so
that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts.

C)    IMPORTED CASES: 7

Amongst the 7 imported cases, 1 (Case 58101) is a Singaporean and
another (Case 58111) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from
Indonesia and India respectively. Another 2 are Work Pass (Case 58102)
and Work Permit (Case 58103) holders currently employed in Singapore who
arrived from the UAE and Myanmar respectively. The remaining cases are
Short-Term Visit Pass holders. Cases 58106 and 58110 are family members
of Singapore Permanent Residents, while Case 58107 was allowed entry
into Singapore as he was already receiving medical care in Singapore and
had returned for further treatment. They had all been placed on SHN upon
arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.

3.               Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
4.               Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.               Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
Please refer to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.               8 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,829 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.
7.               There are currently 45 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 39 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
