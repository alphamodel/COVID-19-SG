His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 22 January – were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.&nbsp;<br><br>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
