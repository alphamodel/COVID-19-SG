4.    There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 9.3%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 0.9%.
