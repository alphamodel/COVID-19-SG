Updates On Border Measures for Travellers From New Zealand and Jiangsu
Province, Mainland China



UPDATES ON BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM NEW ZEALAND AND JIANGSU PROVINCE, MAINLAND CHINA


Published Date: 28 Aug 2021

        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the
global COVID-19 situation and regularly reviews Singapore’s border
measures to manage the risk of importation from travellers and onward
local transmission. We will tighten our border measures for travellers
from New Zealand, given the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases
there. As the situation in Jiangsu province, Mainland China has
improved, we will allow travellers from Jiangsu province, Mainland China
to undergo a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test upon arrival,
and to go about their activities in Singapore if the PCR test result is
negative.
TRAVELLERS FROM NEW ZEALAND TO SERVE 7-DAY SHN AT PLACE OF RESIDENCE
2.       Given the increased cases observed in New Zealand, we will be
tightening border control measures for travellers with travel history to
New Zealand. From 30 AUGUST 2021, 2359 HOURS:

a.    Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs) and Long-Term
Pass holders entering Singapore with travel history to New Zealand,
within the last 21 days before departure for Singapore, will be subject
to an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test¹ a 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at
their place of residence, and a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of the
SHN period.
b.    Short-term travellers holding an Air Travel Pass (ATP) with travel
history to New Zealand, within the last 21 days before departure for
