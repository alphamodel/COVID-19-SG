CASE DETAILS

A)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1

There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to a previous case.

Case 60389 is a 43 year-old male Singaporean who is the spouse of Case
60102[1]. He works as an event planner but has not been at work since 1
February. He had been identified as a close contact of Case 60102 and
was placed on quarantine on 9 February. His swab taken on 9 February was
negative for COVID-19.

He developed anosmia on 15 February during quarantine but did not report
his symptom. On 20 February, he developed a fever and self-medicated,
again without informing MOH of his symptoms. The next day, he was tested
for COVID-19 as part of our protocol to test individuals during
quarantine. His test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the
same day and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. His serological test result has come back negative,
indicating that this is likely a current infection. He has been tested
for the B117 strain, and the result is pending.

Individuals on quarantine or SHN are required to declare any symptoms
promptly, and to report their health status to MOH every day. They are
provided with a list of COVID-19 symptoms to look out for, as well as
reporting instructions, at the start of their isolation period. We
remind these individuals to be socially responsible and to report their
symptoms promptly, even if these are early/mild.



B)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.



C)  IMPORTED CASES: 9

Amongst the 9 imported cases,

•  2 (Cases 60399 and 60406) are Singaporeans who returned
from Indonesia and the UK.
•  3 (Cases 60398, 60400 and 60414) are Dependant’s Pass
holders who arrived from India, Indonesia and the US.
•  1 (Case 60397) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from the
Philippines.
•  3 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Indonesia and
Myanmar, of whom 1 (Case 60412) is a foreign domestic worker.

They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.

4.  Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.

5.  Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,746 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from

hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical

clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed
