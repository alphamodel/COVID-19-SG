59715, 59717, 59718, 59724 and 59725) are foreign domestic workers.

Cases 59700 and 59712 arrived from Indonesia and the US respectively for

her child who is a Singaporean.
They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.
Case 59697 is a Work Permit holder who has not started work since his
arrival in Singapore. He arrived from Bangladesh on 6 January, and
served SHN at a dedicated facility. His swab done on 17 January during
SHN was negative for COVID-19.  But on 18 January, he was placed on
quarantine and isolation as he had been identified as a flight contact
of Case 59423.  He was tested on 26 January even though he is
asymptomatic, and his result came back positive for COVID-19 infection.
His serology test result has come back negative, and he has also tested
preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further
confirmatory tests.
Case 59703 is a Work Pass holder who works as a software engineer at
Pacific International Lines Pte Ltd. He arrived from India on 27
December 2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 10 January
2021. His swab done on 7 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19.
He subsequently worked from home from 11 January to 21 January. He
developed nausea on 25 January, and sought medical treatment at a
general practitioner clinic on 26 January. As he also reported
intermittent cough and a sore throat, he was tested for COVID-19 and his
test came back positive on 27 January. He has also tested preliminarily
positive for the B117 strain. His serological test result has come back
positive, which indicates a likely past infection.
Given their recent travel history, we have classified both cases as
imported.
4.     Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases, including their household
members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and
will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that
we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests
for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected
by them.
5.     Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
