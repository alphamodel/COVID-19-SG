Another 2 (Cases 57462 and 57489) are Work Pass holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Germany on 30 August and the Philippines on 29 August.

All 4 cases are asymptomatic, and were detected through our proactive testing.<br><br>All cases in the community today are linked to previous cases or clusters. Case 57470 had been identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. He was tested during quarantine to determine his status, even though he is asymptomatic. Case 57463 was tested as part of our efforts to screen individuals working in frontline COVID-19 operations, and Case 57461 was swabbed as part of our active case finding efforts. The remaining case (Case 57495) was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>c)&nbsp; &nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 28</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Amongst the 28 cases residing in dormitories, 16 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The remaining 12 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.<br>&nbsp;<br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past infections.[1] The serological test result for 1 case has come back positive so far, which indicates a likely past infection.<br>&nbsp;<br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
