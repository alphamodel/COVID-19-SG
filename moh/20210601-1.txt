B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 3
Amongst the 3 imported cases,
• 2 (Cases 63919 and 63926) are Singaporeans who returned from India and
the Philippines.
• 1 (Case 63925) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from the
Philippines for a work project in Singapore.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
Case 63925 is a 38 year-old male Philippines national who arrived from
the Philippines on 23 April 2021 for a work project in Singapore, and
served SHN at a dedicated facility until 7 May. His pre-departure test
taken in the Philippines on 22 April, on-arrival test in Singapore on 23
April, as well as his swab done on 6 May during SHN, were negative for
COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested for
COVID-19 on 29 May, and his test result came back positive on 30 May.
His Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and
his serology test result has also come back positive. Given that these
indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported
based on his travel history. He is likely to be shedding minute
fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and
infective to others.
4. Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5. Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
Closure of Hua Zai outlets from 1 June
6. MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst individuals
who work at Hua Zai outlets. Our epidemiological investigations have
found that there is likely ongoing transmission among individuals who
work at some of the Hua Zai outlets. The Hua Zai outlet in NTUC Foodfare
(308 Anchorvale Road) has been closed since 30 May, following the
detection of cases linked to the coffee shop. To break any potential
chain of transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, all 26
Hua Zai outlets will be closed to all members of the public starting
from 1 June 2021 and re-open 14 days later, on 15 June 2021.
