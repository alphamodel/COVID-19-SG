SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES

4.     Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased
from 17 cases in the week before to 325 cases in the past week. We are
likely to see rising cases in the coming days as we step up efforts to
detect them to contain their spread in the community. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also increased from 8 cases in the
week before to 31 cases in the past week. The 7-day moving average
number of all linked community cases and all unlinked community cases
are 42.0 and 4.4 respectively.

Additional cases linked to Jurong Fishery Port cluster

7.     MOH is investigating COVID-19 cases involving markets and food
centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who visited Jurong
Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the markets and food
centres. There are currently clusters detected at Hong Lim Market & Food
Centre and Chong Boon Market & Food Centre. On 17 July, MOH also
announced cases detected amongst fishmongers working at Amoy Street Food
Centre, 527 Ang Mo Kio Market, Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, Bukit
Timah Wet Market, Geylang Bahru Market, Geylang Serai Malay Market,
Redhill Market, Taman Jurong Market, Telok Blangah Crescent Block 11,
726 West Coast Wet Market and Whampoa Wet Market. Today, we have
detected additional cases amongst fishmongers working at Haig Road
Market and Cooked Food Centre, Jurong Central Plaza and Shunfu Mart.

8.     We are closely monitoring the situation and taking action to
quickly contain and manage the cases, including contact tracing,
quarantine and aggressive testing. To better enable contact tracing to
ringfence cases, from 19 July, the National Environment Agency and Town
Councils will be progressively implementing access control with interim
fencing and mandatory SafeEntry check-in at markets where COVID-19 cases
have been detected amongst stallholders or stall assistants.

Ongoing transmission at KTV clubs/lounges

9.     MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst social
hostesses who had frequented KTV lounges or clubs currently operating as
F&B outlets, and their close social contacts. Our epidemiological
investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at
the following KTV lounges/clubs:

-   Maze Club (2 Aliwal Street);
-   China Doll (1 Sophia Road);
-   Club Myth (1 Coleman Street); and
-   Martell W Ktv Chivas (6 Foch Road).



10.     All visitors to the affected premises are advised to monitor
their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as
possible, for 14 days from their date of visit or interaction. They are
encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell. We also
advise all visitors to markets and food centres to avoid crowds and to
do your marketing during off-peak hours, or at supermarkets, and to
strictly observe the safe management measures.

CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

11.     243 cases are currently warded in hospital.Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 12 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 1 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU). None amongst these 13 cases is fully
vaccinated.

12.     There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 17 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 11 are unvaccinated, 6 are partially vaccinated and none was fully
vaccinated.

doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme. The
total number of doses administered was 6,726,540, covering 4,136,551
individuals. 2,676,171 individuals have completed the full vaccination
