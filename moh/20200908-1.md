He had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and was tested while serving SHN at a dedicated facility.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b)&nbsp; &nbsp;Cases in the community: 0&nbsp;<br><br></strong>There are no cases in the community today. <br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cases residing in dormitories: 46&nbsp;<br><br></strong>Amongst the 46 cases residing in dormitories, 25 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 21 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections.&nbsp;[1]<sup style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;</sup>The serological test results for 4 cases have come back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong style="font-size: 13px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).

This was a precautionary measure following the detection of 3 cases (Cases 56184, 56626 and 56826) who had worked at or visited the shop, even though the risk of infection for visitors is assessed to be low. In all, 254 individuals were tested, and all the results have come back negative.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found&nbsp;<br><br></strong>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
