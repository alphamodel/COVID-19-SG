    <body><h1>Issuance of Correction Direction Under the Protection From Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 On Falsehoods Regarding Patient Who Allegedly Suffered Miscarriage After Four Hour Wait At Kkh</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 27 Mar 2022</p> <p style="margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Ministry of Health (MOH) is aware that “Wake Up, Singapore” (WUSG) had posted allegations across its website, Facebook, and Instagram pages on 23 March 2022, which claimed that a COVID-positive patient who was 20 weeks pregnant had suffered a miscarriage after waiting four hours to see a doctor at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) A&amp;E department in February 2022. These allegations are false.<br><br>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">KKH had identified the patient in question based on a screenshot of a hospital bill accompanying WUSG’s posts, which contained discrepancies with the patient’s account of events. Subsequent&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">investigations by KKH have confirmed that&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">the patient had been seen by a doctor within an hour of her arrival at KKH in February 2022, and did not suffer any miscarriage</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.<br><br>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; text-align: left; font-size: 16px;">On 25 March 2022, WUSG published further posts on its Facebook and Instagram pages, stating that they have been informed by the patient that her recollection was false, and that WUSG “may have been fed lies at every turn”. WUSG has also apologised to KKH for publishing these allegations.<br><br>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Notwithstanding WUSG’s apology, the allegations are serious and have been circulated to various other platforms. This could lead to the erosion of public trust in the credibility and professionalism of our healthcare system and institutions. Accordingly, the Minister for Health has instructed&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to “Wake Up, Singapore” in respect of the falsehoods, to ensure that the public is provided with the full facts. “Wake Up, Singapore” is required to publish the correction notices as specified by the POFMA Office for each webpage and social media post containing the falsehoods.&nbsp;<br><br>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; text-align: left; font-size: 16px;">The Government takes a serious view of these falsehoods, which appear to have been fabricated. The matter has been referred to the relevant authorities for investigation. KKH had also lodged a Police Report on 25 March 2022.&nbsp;<br><br>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article “Corrections regarding patient who allegedly suffered miscarriage after four-hour wait at KKH” at <a href="https://www.gov.sg/article/factually260322" title="" class="" target="">https://www.gov.sg/article/factually260322</a></span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.<br><br>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; text-align: left; font-size: 16px;">We urge the public not to spread unsubstantiated information, which may cause public alarm.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial;">MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;<br></strong></span><strong style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">27 MARCH 2022</span></strong></p></body>
