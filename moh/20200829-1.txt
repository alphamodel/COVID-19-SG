A) IMPORTED CASES: 3 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Pass holder, 1 Student’s
Pass holder)
Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 56777) is a Singaporean who
returned to Singapore from India on 16 August. Another case (Case 56791)
is a Work Pass holder currently employed in Singapore who arrived from
Bangladesh on 17 August. The remaining case (Case 56778) is a Student’s
Pass holder who arrived from Bangladesh on 17 August. All of them had
been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore,
and had been tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Work Permit holder)
There is 1 case in the community who is currently unlinked. Case 56765
was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in
the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the
dormitories. Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress.
In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for his household contacts to
determine if he could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 47
Amongst the 47 cases residing in dormitories, 37 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 10 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with ARI symptoms. This allows us to
pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to
ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively
containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.
2.        Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.       Of the new cases, 98% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.        Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.        110 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 55,447 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.
6. There are currently 70 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of
these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care
unit. 1,173 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
