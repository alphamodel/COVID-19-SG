A)  IMPORTED CASES: 13 (4 Singaporeans, 2 Permanent Residents, 1
Work Pass holder, 5 Work Permit holders, 1 Student’s Pass holder)
Amongst the 13 imported cases, 4 (Cases 57120, 57123, 57144 and 57145)
are Singaporeans and 2 (Cases 57121 and 57122) are Permanent Residents
who returned to Singapore from India between 24 August and 26 August,
and the Philippines on 25 August. Another 6 (Cases 57114, 57118, 57125,
57126, 57129 and 57132) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently
employed in Singapore who arrived from India on 25 August, Indonesia on
24 August and 25 August, and the Philippines on 23 August and 25 August.
The remaining case (Case 57124) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived
from India on 25 August.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 4 (1 Work Pass holder, 3 Work Permit
holders)
Of the 4 cases in the community, 3 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. All 4 cases are asymptomatic, and were detected
through our proactive testing.
2 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters.
Case 57147 had been identified as a contact of a previously confirmed
case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. Case 57131 is linked to
the cluster at CDPL Tuas Dormitory, and was detected as a result of our
Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and
process sectors who are living outside the dormitories.
The other 2 community cases are currently unlinked. Both (Cases 57139
and 57149) were detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing,
even though they are asymptomatic.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an
average of 2 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 23
Amongst the 23 cases residing in dormitories, 5 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 18 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections.¹ The serological test result for 1 case has come back
positive so far, which indicates likely past infection.
2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.  Of the new cases, 88% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.  66 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 56,333 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.  There are currently 51 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 611 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
