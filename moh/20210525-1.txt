    workers.

&nbsp;
-   1 (Case 63695) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
    Papua New Guinea to visit his Singapore family member.

They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
Case 63705 is a 62 year-old male Singaporean who had been in Indonesia
since 7 June 2020. He returned to Singapore on 28 March 2021, and served
SHN at a dedicated facility until 11 April. Both his on-arrival test on
28 March, as well as his swab done on 10 April during SHN, were negative
for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a
COVID-19 pre-departure test on 21 May in preparation for a trip to
Indonesia. His test result came back positive on 22 May. His Ct value
was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and his serology
test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate
likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported based on
his travel history. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the
virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.
4.       Please refer to the Annexes and MOH's daily Situation Report
(http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.       Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
6.       MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the Westlite
Woodlands Dormitory cluster for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28
days), the cluster has now been closed.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.       13 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 61,329 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.       There are currently 250 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 2 are in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 279 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 32 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
