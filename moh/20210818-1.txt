2.      In addition, 153,020 doses of other vaccines recognised in the
World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been
administered as of 17 August 2021, covering 84,172 individuals. In

6.      There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 8.8%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 1.5%.
