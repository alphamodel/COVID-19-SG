    <body><h1>301 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 06 Aug 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 6 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 301 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there are 4 cases in the community, of whom 3 are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents and 1 is a Work Pass holder.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, there are 4 imported cases, who had all been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We continue to aggressively test the final batch of dormitory residents, and remain on track to clear all the dormitories by 7 August, except for a few standalone blocks in the dormitories that serve as quarantine facilities. Depending on the prevalence of COVID-19 at the remaining dormitories whose residents are being tested, the daily case counts may vary. We expect the number to remain volatile in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter as the Inter-agency Taskforce completes the dormitory clearance.</p><p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.</p></body>
