Given its high transmissibility and spread to many parts of the world, we should expect to find more Omicron cases at our borders and also within our community. It is important for everyone to continue to play their part and remain vigilant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and to come forward to receive your vaccination or booster dose when offered.&nbsp;<br><br></span><strong style=\"font-family: Arial;\">MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong></span><strong><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">20 DECEMBER 2021</span></strong></p></p>", "PressCategory": ["Highlights", "Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "suspect-omicron-cluster-at-anytime-fitness-(bukit-timah-shopping-centre)_20Dec2021", "CurrentPageUrl": null, "CustomPressWidgetLocationUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
