These allegations are false.<br><br>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">KKH had identified the patient in question based on a screenshot of a hospital bill accompanying WUSG\u2019s posts, which contained discrepancies with the patient\u2019s account of events. Subsequent&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">investigations by KKH have confirmed that&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">the patient had been seen by a doctor within an hour of her arrival at KKH in February 2022, and did not suffer any miscarriage</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">.<br><br>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; text-align: left; font-size: 16px;\">On 25 March 2022, WUSG published further posts on its Facebook and Instagram pages, stating that they have been informed by the patient that her recollection was false, and that WUSG \u201cmay have been fed lies at every turn\u201d. WUSG has also apologised to KKH for publishing these allegations.<br><br>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Notwithstanding WUSG\u2019s apology, the allegations are serious and have been circulated to various other platforms. This could lead to the erosion of public trust in the credibility and professionalism of our healthcare system and institutions. Accordingly, the Minister for Health has instructed&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to \u201cWake Up, Singapore\u201d in respect of the falsehoods, to ensure that the public is provided with the full facts. \u201cWake Up, Singapore\u201d is required to publish the correction notices as specified by the POFMA Office for each webpage and social media post containing the falsehoods.&nbsp;<br><br>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; text-align: left; font-size: 16px;\">The Government takes a serious view of these falsehoods, which appear to have been fabricated. The matter has been referred to the relevant authorities for investigation. KKH had also lodged a Police Report on 25 March 2022.&nbsp;<br><br>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections regarding patient who allegedly suffered miscarriage after four-hour wait at KKH\u201d at <a href=\"https://www.gov.sg/article/factually260322\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">https://www.gov.sg/article/factually260322</a></span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">.<br><br>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; text-align: left; font-size: 16px;\">We urge the public not to spread unsubstantiated information, which may cause public alarm.<br><br></span><strong style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial;\">MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;<br></strong></span><strong style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">27 MARCH 2022</span></strong></p>", "PressCategory": ["Highlights", "Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "issuance-of-correction-direction-under-the-protection-from-online-falsehoods-and-manipulation-act-2019-on-falsehoods-regarding-patient-who-allegedly-suffered-miscarriage-after-four-hour-wait-at-kkh", "CurrentPageUrl": null, "CustomPressWidgetLocationUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
