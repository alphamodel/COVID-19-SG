Published Date: 28 Jun 2020

         As of 28 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 213 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 11 (6 Singaporeans, 2 Work Pass holders, 3
Work Permit holders)
Of the 11 cases in the community,  8 had been picked up as a result of
our proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed
on quarantine earlier.
Amongst the 6 Singaporean cases, 1 (Case 43297) was tested as part of
our proactive screening of school students [1] who are diagnosed with
acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. She
is a student at East Spring Secondary School, but had not gone to school
since onset of symptoms. Another case (Case 43315) had been identified
as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and had already been
quarantined earlier. He was swabbed during quarantine to verify his
status. 2 cases (Cases 43316 and 43317) were detected due to our
proactive surveillance of persons working at dormitories or deployed to
frontline COVID-19 operations, even though they are asymptomatic.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining 2 cases
(Cases 43429 and 43483).
All 5 Work Pass/ Work Permit holders (Cases 43426, 43484, 43485, 43486
and 43487) were detected from proactive screening of workers in
essential services, even though they are asymptomatic.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 6 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 4 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 202
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.       Of the new cases, 93% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.        MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the dormitories
at 15A Senoko Way and 65 & 67 Tuas View Walk 2 for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.       In the past week (21 June to 27 June), MOH has uncovered links
for 7 previously unlinked cases.
6.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.      345 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 37,508 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.         There are currently 184 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 5,741 are isolated and cared for
