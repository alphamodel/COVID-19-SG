His pooled test on 15 April came back positive for COVID-19, and an individual swab done on 16 April was also positive for COVID-19 infection. He was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and developed a fever on the same day.</p><p>Another test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) on 16 April was negative for COVID-19 infection but a subsequent test on 17 April by NPHL was again positive for COVID-19. His serological test result has come back positive, which is indicative of a past infection. He could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude when he had been infected, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.</p><p><u>Case 62045</u></p><p>Case 62045 is a 41 year-old female Singapore Permanent Resident. She works as an accountant at OM Universal Pte Ltd (11 Kaki Bukit Road 1) but had not gone to work since onset of symptoms.</p><p>She developed a cough in the evening of 14 April after work, and sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner clinic the next day, where she was tested for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 16 April and she was conveyed to NCID in an ambulance. Her serology test result is pending.</p><p>One of her household contacts is Case 61536, a Work Pass holder who arrived from India on 2 April. He tested positive for COVID-19 infection on 2 April but was subsequently assessed to be a recovered case based on his positive serology result on 4 April.</p><p><u>Case 62057</u></p><p>Case 62057 is a 31 year-old female Swiss national who is a Work Pass holder. She is a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore and colleague of Case 61993[1], and had interacted with him on 12 April.</p><p>She developed a sore throat on 15 April but did not seek medical treatment. As she had been identified as a close contact of Case 61993, she was contacted by MOH on 16 April and placed on quarantine. She reported her symptom and was conveyed in an ambulance to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital where she was tested for COVID-19. Her test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 16 April. Her serology test result is pending.</p><p><u>Case 62063</u></p><p>Case 62063 is a 35 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass holder. He is the brother of Case 61993 [1], and his household contact. He works at DBS Bank (2 Changi Business Park Crescent) but has largely been working from home. He last went back to his workplace between 6 April and 9 April.</p><p>As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 61993, he was placed on home quarantine on 15 April. He developed a fever on 16 April and was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID after he informed MOH of his symptom. He was tested for COVID-19 and his test came back positive on 17 April. His serology test result is pending.</p><p>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.</p><p><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0<br></strong><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.</p><p><strong>c) Imported cases: 35</strong></p><p>Amongst the 35 imported cases,</p><ul><li>5 (Cases 62054, 62058, 62077, 62078 and 62097) are Singaporeans and 5 (Cases 62055, 62060, 62061, 62073 and 62075) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia and Liberia.</li><li>4 (Cases 62033, 62034, 62052 and 62053) are Dependant\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from Nepal.</li><li>1 (Case 62050) is a Student\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from India.</li><li>1 (Case 62051) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from India.</li><li>17 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines, of whom 8 (Cases 62038, 62039, 62040, 62041, 62081, 62082, 62086 and 62095) are foreign domestic workers.</li><li>2 (Cases 62048 and 62049) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders.
