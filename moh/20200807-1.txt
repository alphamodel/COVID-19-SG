EXERCISING SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

12.  Since 14 February 2020, healthcare professionals have been
providing five-Day MCs for patients with symptoms of acute respiratory
infection. Yet more than 35% of these cases had continued to engage in
activities after symptoms onset and before they were isolated. Of these,
nearly half went to work, and many visited shopping centres,
supermarkets and hawker centres.

13. Any person convicted of an offence under Regulation 3(3) of
the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 - Stay Orders) Regulations 2020, or
under the Infectious Diseases Act, is liable to a fine of up to $10,000,
or up to six months’ imprisonment, or both.

14.  We urge individuals to adhere to the regulations in place,
to prevent putting our loved ones and others in the community at risk of
infection. The Ministry of Health will not hesitate to take strict
enforcement actions against those who place the public at risk of
COVID-19 infection by failing to comply with the Infectious Diseases
(COVID-19 - Stay Orders) Regulations 2020 or with SHN requirements.
