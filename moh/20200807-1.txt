281 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 242 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 07 Aug 2020

                   As of 7 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health
(MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 242 cases of COVID-19
infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A)    IMPORTED CASES: 6 (2 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 2 Work
Pass holders, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder, 1 Long-Term Visit Pass holder)

All 6 imported cases arrived from India between 25 July and 27 July.
Amongst them, 2 (Cases 54872 and 54877) are Singaporeans/ Permanent
Residents returning to Singapore. Another 2 cases (Cases 54873 and
54874) are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in Singapore.
The remaining cases are a Dependant’s Pass holder (Case 54761) and a
Long-Term Visit Pass holder (Case 54771).

All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated
facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.

B)    CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1  (1 Singaporean)

There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
54870 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to
identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further
spread. Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 14 days. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.

C)    CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 235

The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in
the dormitories, except for a few standalone blocks in the dormitories
that serve as quarantine facilities. The workers in these quarantine
facilities will be tested when their isolation ends, and we expect the
case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down
thereafter.

2.               Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please

3.               Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters,
while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.               In the past week (31 July to 6 August), MOH has
uncovered links for 1 previously unlinked case in the community.
5.               Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
Please refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.

well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
