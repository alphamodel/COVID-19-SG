    <body><h1>Updates On Border Measures and Travel Insurance </h1>
    <p>Published Date: 16 Jan 2021</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Multi-Ministry Taskforce regularly reviews Singaporeâ€™s border measures to manage the risk of importation and onward local transmission from travellers. Given the resurgence of COVID-19 cases around the world, we will be putting in place more stringent measures for travellers to manage the risk of importation.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">On-arrival Testing for Travellers<br></span><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We currently require travellers who are not Singapore Citizens (SCs) or Permanent Residents (PRs), and who have recent travel history to high-risk countries/ regions, to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure. These travellers are then required to serve their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and they are tested at the end of their SHN.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given the emergence of new virus variants and the worsening COVID-19 situation around the world, we will put in place additional border control measures for all travellers. In particular, <strong>from 24 January 2021, 2359 hours, all travellers (including SCs and PRs) will need to take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore</strong><sup>1</sup>. The prevailing SHN requirements, including the PCR test at the end of the SHN, will continue.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Further Precautions for Travellers from the United Kingdom and South Africa<br><br></span>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We had earlier restricted entry and transit for all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to the UK and South Africa. This arose from concerns of a more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus circulating in these countries.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a further precaution, from 18 January 2021, 2359 hours, until further notice, all returning SCs and PRs from the UK and South Africa will be subject to an additional 7-day self-isolation at their place of residence, following their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. The returnees from the UK and South Africa will be tested at the end of their SHN (as per the current requirement), and again after they have completed their 7-day self-isolation period. These further precautions will apply to travellers who are currently serving their SHN.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Insurance Coverage<br></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, short-term visitors entering Singapore under the Air Travel Pass (ATP) and Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs) are required to bear the full costs of medical treatment, should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19 or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With effect from <strong>31 January 2021, 2359 hours, visitors applying to enter Singapore under the ATP and RGLs will need to have travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000.</strong> The travel insurance will help them pay for the costs of their medical treatment in Singapore. The visitors can purchase the travel insurance from Singapore-based or overseas insurers. A list of available insurance products can be found at the <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health" title="" class="" target="">SafeTravel website</a>.<br><br><strong>Looking Ahead to Further Reopening<br></strong><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community. The Ministry of Health will also continue to review the data and evidence on any new viral strains and update the measures accordingly.&nbsp;<br><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any changes to border measures will be updated on the <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health" title="" class="" target="">SafeTravel website</a>. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and treatment.&nbsp;<br><br>10.&nbsp; &nbsp;We seek the continued cooperation of all Singaporeans to remain united and disciplined in our fight against COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>16 JANUARY 2021<br><br><sup></sup></strong><sup>1</sup> To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport, travellers are strongly encouraged to register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore at <a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com" title="" class="" target="">https://safetravel.changiairport.com</a>.<br></p></body>
