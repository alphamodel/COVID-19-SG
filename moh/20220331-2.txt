Resumption of In-person Visits to Hospitals and Residential Care Homes



RESUMPTION OF IN-PERSON VISITS TO HOSPITALS AND RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES


Published Date: 31 Mar 2022

        The Ministry of Health (MOH) will resume in-person visits to all
hospital wards¹ and residential care homes (‘Homes’) from 4 April 2022.
2.     MOH had earlier announced the suspension of in-person visits to
hospitals and Homes until 3 April 2022 (inclusive). As the daily number
of local COVID-19 cases has fallen, and the situation in our hospitals
and Homes is starting to improve, IN-PERSON VISITS TO HOSPITAL WARDS AND
HOMES WILL RESUME FROM 4 APRIL 2022.
3.     As hospitals and Homes are settings with vulnerable
patients/residents, visitors will have to comply with the safe
management measures (SMMs) to better protect the patient/resident.
4.     In-person visits are only allowed for individuals (i.e. patients,
residents and visitors) who are fully vaccinated. As a concession, we
will allow visits for individuals (i.e. patients, residents and
visitors) who are medically ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination. Under
exceptional circumstances, hospitals and Homes may also exercise
flexibility in their visitor policies on a case-by-case basis. More
details can be found in the Annex.
5.     We understand the past months have been difficult for
patients/residents, and their family members and loved ones as in-person
visits were suspended, and thank everyone for their understanding. We
seek their continued cooperation to comply with the SMMs to keep
patients/ residents safe as in-person visits are resumed. MOH will
review and calibrate these measures as the situation evolves.
