    <body><h1>No New Cases of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 10 Dec 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of 10 December 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed that there are no new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br> <br>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;           There are 6 imported cases, who had already been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final confirmatory test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) on 10 December 2020 has confirmed that the 83 year-old male Singaporean on board Royal Caribbean Internationalâ€™s Quantum of the Seas does not have COVID-19 infection. The sample taken from the individual this morning came back negative for the virus. This follows two Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests conducted yesterday by NPHL, one on a re-test of his original sample, and the other on a fresh sample taken yesterday, which had also come back negative. We have rescinded the Quarantine Orders of his close contacts, who had earlier been placed on quarantine as a precautionary measure while investigations were ongoing. MOH will support the laboratory on board the Quantum of the Seas in its review of its testing processes.<br><strong><br>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>10 DECEMBER 2020<br></strong></p></body>
