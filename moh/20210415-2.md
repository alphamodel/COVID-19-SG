    <body><h1>Issuance of Correction Directions Under the Protection From Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act On Falsehoods On Covid-19 Vaccination</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 15 Apr 2021</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Ministry of Health (MOH) is aware of falsehoods circulating that the COVID-19 vaccination has clear and causal links with stroke and heart attack. There are also third parties who have exploited the sharing of personal experiences by individuals, by reposting these personal accounts and making unsubstantiated claims about vaccine-related adverse reactions. They often continue to do so despite the original posts being removed or made private.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Health has instructed the POFMA Office to issue Correction Directions on: (i) Facebook posts published on the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) and Goh Meng Seng People’s Power Party on 2 April 2021 and 7 April 2021; and (ii) an article by Singapore Uncensored published on their website and their Facebook page on 7 April 2021. They will be required to carry a correction notice alongside their posts.<br></p><p><strong>Corrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods posted by Goh Meng Seng and Singapore Uncensored</strong><br></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are false statements on COVID-19 vaccination contained in multiple Facebook posts and a website, namely:<br></p><p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Posts published on the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) and Goh Meng Seng People’s Power Party on 2 April 2021, implying that COVID-19 vaccination had caused or substantially contributed to a stroke suffered by a doctor;<br></p><p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Posts published on the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) and Goh Meng Seng People’s Power Party on 7 April 2021, implying that COVID-19 vaccination had caused or substantially contributed to the death of an 81-year-old man; and<br></p><p>iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An article published on the Singapore Uncensored website on 7 April 2021 (and subsequently shared on the Facebook page of Singapore Uncensored the same day) stating that an 81-year-old man had passed away from alleged vaccination complications.<br></p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These allegations are false. As of 14 April 2021, there is no credible evidence for an increased risk of heart attack or stroke with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines which are currently approved and offered in Singapore.<br></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The medical team caring for the doctor has assessed that the doctor’s current condition is highly unlikely to be related to the COVID-19 vaccination, and Mount Elizabeth Hospital had issued a clarification on 4 April 2021.<br></p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cause of death of the 81-year-old man was ischaemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to the heart muscles). The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) Forensic Medicine Division has reported that based on the post-mortem, there was no evidence of acute anaphylaxis or an allergic reaction at the injection site of the COVID-19 vaccine. There was extensive narrowing of the three main blood vessels supplying blood to the muscles of the heart due to atherosclerosis (build up of plaques over time in the blood vessels that obstruct blood flow).<br></p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article “Corrections and Clarifications Regarding Falsehoods on COVID-19 Vaccination” at&nbsp;<a href="https://gov.sg/article/factually150421  " title="" class="" target=""></a><a href="https://www.gov.sg/article/factually150421" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gov.sg/article/factually150421&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618539805061000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPZ0_OS8-eZ7C-2H8h4-oRoXcXTw">https://www.gov.sg/article/<wbr>factually150421</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COVID-19 vaccines that are used in Singapore have been assessed to be safe and efficacious by both the HSA and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. Medical teams are well-equipped and measures are in place at all vaccination sites to ensure the safety of vaccine recipients pre-, during, and post-vaccination. All vaccine-related incidents are taken seriously and healthcare professionals are required to report these incidents expediently to the MOH and HSA.<br></p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unfounded rumors.
