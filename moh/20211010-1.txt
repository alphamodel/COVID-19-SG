|     with 2,176 in the community, 631 in the migrant worker            |
|     dormitories and 2 imported cases. The fall in the number of cases |
|     today is likely due to fewer swabs being done over the weekend at |
|     Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and polyclinics, and   |
|     is not indicative that the epidemic curve is bending.             |
