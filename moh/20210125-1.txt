• 3 (Cases 59601, 59606 and 59638) are Student’s Pass holders who

• 17 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India,
Indonesia and Malaysia, of whom 3 (Cases 59621, 59636 and 59640) are
foreign domestic workers.
• 4 (Cases 59622, 59624, 59625 and 59626) are Short-Term Visit Pass
holders who arrived from India to visit their relatives who are
Singaporeans or Singapore Permanent Residents.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
Case 59629 is a 19 year-old female Singaporean who returned from the UK
on 6 December and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 20 December.
Her swab done on 16 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19. She
is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure
test on 23 January in preparation for her return to the UK. Her test
result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to the
National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Her Ct value was very high,
which is indicative of a low viral load, and her serology test result
has also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past
infection, we have classified the case as imported based on her travel
history. She is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA,
which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.
