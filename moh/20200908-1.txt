A)   IMPORTED CASES: 1 (1 SINGAPOREAN)
Case 57186 is a Singaporean who returned to Singapore from India on 24
August. He had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival
in Singapore, and was tested while serving SHN at a dedicated facility.
B)   CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an
average of 2 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C)   CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 46
Amongst the 46 cases residing in dormitories, 25 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 21 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections. [1]The serological test results for 4 cases have come
back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     Of the new cases, 98% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
4.     MOH has completed our screening and testing of individuals who
had visited SLR Revolution at Excelsior Shopping Centre (5 Coleman
Street) between 15 August and 18 August 2020. This was a precautionary
measure following the detection of 3 cases (Cases 56184, 56626 and
56826) who had worked at or visited the shop, even though the risk of
infection for visitors is assessed to be low. In all, 254 individuals
were tested, and all the results have come back negative.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     53 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 56,461 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 48 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 555 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
