As of 17 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 247 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows: \n<br>\n<br><strong>a) Imported cases: 0\n</strong><br>\n<br>There are no imported cases today.  \n<br>\n<br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 5</strong> (2 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 3 Work Permit holders)\n<br>\n<br>Of the 5 cases in the community, 2 had been picked up as a result of our proactive surveillance and screening, and the remaining 3 had already been placed on quarantine.\n<br>\n<br>Amongst the 2 Singaporean cases, 1 (Case 41145) is asymptomatic but was tested as his work involves interacting with security guards at dormitories. The other case (Case 41152) is a family member of a previously confirmed case, and had already been quarantined earlier. She had been swabbed during quarantine to verify her status.\n<br>\n<br>Amongst the 3 Work Pass/ Work Permit holders, 2 (Cases 41030 and 41250) had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had already been quarantined at government quarantine facilities. They had been swabbed during quarantine to verify their status, even though Case 41030 is asymptomatic. The remaining case also does not have symptoms, but was tested as part of our efforts to screen workers in essential services. \n<br>\n<br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted serological tests to determine if these cases are current or past infections.<sup>1</sup> The serological test result for Case 41030 has come back positive, which indicates likely past infection. The test results for the remaining cases are pending. \n<br>\n<br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per day in the past week.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.\n<br>\n<br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 242\n</strong><br>\n<br>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers. \n<br>\n<br>2. Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing. \n<br>\n<br><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong>\n<br>\n<br>4. In the past week (10 June to 16 June), MOH has uncovered links for 11 previously unlinked cases. \n<br>\n<br>5. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

In all, 31,938 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities. \n<br>\n<br>7. There are currently 257 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 2 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 8,995 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 26 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection. \n<br>\n<br><strong>COVID-19 Test for Persons under Stay-Home Notice \n</strong><br>\n<br>8. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced on 15 June 2020 that all inbound and outbound travellers who enter Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, and leave Singapore from 17 June, 2359 hours, respectively will be required to pay for their COVID-19 tests, where applicable. In addition, incoming travellers who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, who enter Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, will be required to pay for their stay at dedicated Stay-Home Notice (SHN) facilities, where applicable. \n<br>\n<br>9. We recognise that there may be Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents who had left Singapore <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">before </span>the prevailing travel advisory was issued on 27 March 2020, and who may be returning in the near future.&nbsp; For such cases, we will allow a grace period, and if they return and enter Singapore by 31 August 2020, we will waive the cost of the COVID-19 tests. &nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>10. We will not automatically swab all persons who are aged 12 or younger before the end of their SHN, as we recognise that the tests could pose difficulties for young children. However, if any of their close contacts are found to be positive, we will initiate the swab tests for them.&nbsp; \n<br>\n<br>11. For avoidance of doubt, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">all travellers, including Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents</span>, who last left Singapore from 27 March 2020 despite the prevailing travel advisory, will have to continue to bear the costs of their stay at dedicated SHN facilities where applicable, as well as the cost of their COVID-19 tests.\n<br>\n<br>[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective to others.<br>\n<br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH\n<br>17 JUNE 2020</strong>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "775-more-cases-discharged-247-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-confirmed", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "Support for Seniors In Phase Two", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1592384700000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "17 Jun 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced that Phase Two will commence on 19 June 2020, as community infection rates have remained generally stable in Phase One. Seniors are especially vulnerable and should be extra careful as more activities resume in Phase Two. </p><p></p><p><strong>Approach for Phase Two</strong></p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Phase Two, with more activities and interactions, there will likely be a higher risk of community transmission. Therefore, we encourage seniors to continue to stay home as much as possible and to limit their interactions to a small regular circle of close contacts. Households may receive up to five visitors a day, and visitors of households with seniors should take extra care to maintain a safe distance from seniors, and practise good hand hygiene. Seniors should continue to avoid peak hours if they need to go out. </p><p></p><p><strong>More senior-centric activities will resume in Phase Two</strong></p><p><em>Senior-centric activities may resume with precautions</em></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior-centric activities organised by the People\u2019s Association, Health Promotion Board, Sport Singapore, and the Council for Third Age (C3A) may resume. However, in order to keep interactions low, these will be limited only to activities that can be done individually, with no sharing of equipment between participants. Examples include computer classes and health talks. These sessions will be kept small for a start, and with safe distancing measures in place. Since Phase One, Senior Activity Centres and Community Resource, Engagement and Support Team (CREST) providers have progressively resumed some individual activities on-site to address seniors\u2019 psychosocial needs, with restrictions on duration and total number of persons per session. From Phase Two, we will ease these restrictions to allow more seniors to benefit from these programmes, so long as safe distancing measures are in place. </p><p></p><p><em>More eldercare services resume</em></p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also resume day care services at most Senior Care Centres and Active Ageing Hubs on 29 June 2020, to support seniors and their caregivers who have to return to work in Phase Two. Providers will contact clients and their caregivers to make the necessary arrangements to return to the centre. All care staff will be tested for COVID-19 before resumption of day care services. We have tested more than 3,600 staff of non-residential community care services so far, and all results were negative. This complements other measures such as safe distancing, limiting group interactions, and ensuring good infection control practices such as hand hygiene and wearing of masks, which providers will continue to enforce to give clients and their caregivers peace of mind. </p><p></p><p><em>Face-to-face visitations at residential care homes may resume</em></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise that it has been a difficult period for family members and caregivers who wish to visit their loved ones at nursing homes. Visits will resume gradually and cautiously in Phase Two, starting from 19 Jun. All nursing homes will need to put in place additional precautionary measures to protect their residents, such as setting aside dedicated visitation areas or safe distancing precautions, and some would only start receiving visitors later after ensuring that these measures are properly implemented. We would like to appeal to family members for their patience and understanding. </p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To minimise the risk of infection within the nursing homes, each resident will be allowed a total of two designated visitors, and only one may visit each day, with each visit limited to 30 minutes. Visitors will be screened prior to entry, and should not visit if unwell. In addition, the total number of visitors allowed each day in a home will also be capped through appointments, especially during the initial period, including the coming weekend of 20 June to 21 June. Caregivers are thus encouraged to work with the nursing homes to make appointments in advance, and to visit over the following weeks, instead of rushing to visit over the coming weekend. We will review these visitor management measures in the coming weeks, and may adjust accordingly, depending on the risk of community transmission.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Steady steps towards a new normal</strong></p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to monitor the situation closely, with the aim of continuing to ease measures until we reach a new normal in Phase Three. We all have a role to play to make this happen. If we stay disciplined and adhere to the safe management measures, we will be able to take steady steps forward, and resume the activities we enjoy. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>17 JUNE 2020</strong></p>", "PressCategory": ["Highlights", "Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "support-for-seniors-in-phase-two", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "247 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection ", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1592377500000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "17 Jun 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 17 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 247 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories.
