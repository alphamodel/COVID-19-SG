Published Date: 07 Jul 2020

1. As of 7 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed
and verified an additional 157 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore.
The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 3 (1 Work Pass holder, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders)
Amongst the 3 imported cases, 2 (Cases 45123 and 45147) are Indian
nationals who are Dependant’s Pass holders, and have returned to
Singapore from India on 23 June. The remaining case (Case 45024) is a
Filipino who returned to Singapore from the Philippines on 19 June. She
is a Work Pass holder who is currently employed in Singapore. All of
them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in
Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 20 (12 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 3
Work Pass holders, 5 Work Permit holders)
Of the 20 cases in the community, 6 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 11 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. 11 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were all
detected through our proactive testing.
12 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or
clusters. Of these, 11 had been identified as contacts of previously
confirmed cases, and had been tested during their quarantine to
determine their status. The remaining case (Case 45087) was swabbed as
part of our proactive screening of workers in essential services, even
though he is asymptomatic.
8 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 5 cases
(Cases 45085, 45089, 45090, 45091 and 45092) were tested as they work in
essential services, even though they are all asymptomatic. The remaining
cases (Cases 45027, 45149 and 45164) were swabbed under our enhanced
community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are
diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at first presentation to a
doctor. This allows us to detect infected individuals early and to
quickly contain further spread.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 8 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 14 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 6 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 134
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2. Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex A for
the summary of the confirmed cases.
3. Of the new cases, 94% are linked to known clusters, while the rest
are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4. In the past week (30 June to 6 July), MOH has uncovered links for 6
previously unlinked cases.
5. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer

hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 41,002 have fully

these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition in
the intensive care unit. 3,893 are isolated and cared for at community
