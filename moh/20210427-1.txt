April, 74 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 80 have

CASE DETAILS
A)   CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to a previous case.
Case 62485 is a 42 year-old male Indonesia national who is a sea crew
working on board bunker tanker MT ALLI. He had not disembarked from the
vessel except to go for COVID-19 vaccination.
As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 62113 [1], he was
placed on quarantine on 18 April at a dedicated facility. He was tested
during quarantine on 19 April and his result was negative for COVID-19.
He subsequently developed a cough and sore throat on 25 April and
reported his symptoms. He was conveyed to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases the next day. His test result came back positive for
COVID-19 infection, and his serology test is negative.
Case 62485 received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 8 April. As it
typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after
completing vaccination, he was likely to have been infected before he
was conferred protection after vaccination.
B)   CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
As part of our investigations into Case 62181 [2], MOH and the Ministry
of Manpower commenced a special testing operations to test residents of
Westlite Woodlands Dormitory (2 Woodlands Sector 2), including recovered
workers, for COVID-19 infection. So far, 24 recovered workers were found
to be positive for COVID-19 [3]. These cases were immediately isolated
and conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.
MOH, together with an expert panel which comprises infectious diseases
and microbiology experts, investigated these cases to assess if they are
re-infection cases, or past infections who are shedding minute fragments
of the virus RNA which are no longer transmissible and infective to
others. Of the 24 cases, 11 cases have been assessed to be shedding
virus fragments, and 5 are likely to be cases of COVID-19 re-infection.
Two more cases have been determined to be negative for COVID-19 upon
re-testing, and the remaining 6 cases are pending assessment by the
expert panel.
All 5 re-infection cases occupied the same room at Westlite Woodlands
Dormitory, together with Cases 62181 and 62225 [4], and there is
currently no evidence of transmission to the rest of the dormitory.
Amongst the re-infection cases, 2 had recently arrived from Bangladesh
on 6 April. Our epidemiological investigations found that they were
likely to have been infected while overseas, and passed the infection to
the others in the room. Further epidemiological investigations are
ongoing at their workplace.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 11
Amongst the 11 imported cases,

-   1 (Case 62494) is a Singaporean and 3 (Cases 62490, 62495 and 62506)
    are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India, Ivory
    Coast and Kazakhstan.
-   2 (Cases 62498 and 62505) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived
    from Nepal.
-   4 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India, Indonesia and
    Malaysia, of whom 1 (Case 62493) is a foreign domestic worker.
-   1 (Case 62492) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from Malaysia.

They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
4.     Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation
Report (https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.     Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.    22 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,704 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 108 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 221 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
