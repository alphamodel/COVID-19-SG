CASE DETAILS

A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1

There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
59280 is a 32 year-old male Singaporean who works as a para-veterinarian
at the Singapore Police Force (2 Mowbray Road). His job mainly involves
tele-consultations with dog handlers.

He developed a fever on 11 January, and sought treatment at a general
practitioner clinic on the same day, where he was tested for COVID-19 as
part of our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13
and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at first
presentation to a doctor.

He had remained at home on medical leave until his result came back
positive for COVID-19 infection on 13 January and he was conveyed in an
ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His
serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is
likely a current infection.

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including his family members and
co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
