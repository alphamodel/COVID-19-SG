        As of 25 July 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified that there are 117 cases of locally transmitted
COVID-19 infection, of which 46 are linked to the Jurong Fishery Port

linked to previous cases, and have already been placed on quarantine. 36
are linked to previous cases and were detected through surveillance. 38
are currently unlinked. Amongst the cases are 2 seniors above 70 years
who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, and are at risk of serious
illness.
2.      There are 8 imported cases, who have already been placed on
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. 4 were
detected upon arrival in Singapore, while 4 developed the illness during
SHN or isolation.
3.      In total, there are 125 new cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore today.

CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
4.      524 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 12 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 2 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU). None amongst these 14 cases is fully

partially vaccinated, have fallen very ill.

5.      There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 15 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed

vaccinated.

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES
6.      Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased
from 324 cases in the week before to 1,056 cases in the past week. We
are likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as
we step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the
community. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also
increased from 24 cases in the week before to 136 cases in the past
week. The 7-day moving average number of all linked community cases and
all unlinked community cases are 131.4 and 19.4 respectively.

ACTIVE CLUSTERS UNDER MONITORING
8.      There are 2 new clusters today. In total, there are currently 25
active clusters, ranging between 3 and 792  infections. MOH has been
monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have
been no more cases linked to the 115 Bukit Merah View Market & Food
Centre, 119 Bukit Merah View and Case 64394 clusters for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.

_Collection of ART self-test kits for visitors to selected markets and
food centres _
9.      MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
markets and food centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who
visited Jurong Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the
markets and food centres. As an added layer of ringfencing to help to
identify cases and prevent further transmission, MOH is working with the
People’s Association to distribute antigen rapid test (ART) self-test
kits to individuals who had visited selected markets and food centres in
the last 14 days, such as residents living in the vicinity of these
centres. The collection will run from 26 to 27 July 2021 at Residents’
Committee Centres in the vicinity of the following locations:
• Geylang Bahru Market and Food Centre (69 Geylang Bahru); and
• 146 Teck Whye Avenue Market (146 Teck Whye Lane).
10.      Eligible persons are strongly encouraged to collect and perform
self-testing using these ART kits. Please refer to
https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/artto check on the nearest Residents’
Committee Centre for self-collection.
PROGRESS OF NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAMME
11. As of 24 July 2021, we have administered a total of 7,130,781, doses
of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme. The total
number of doses administered was 7,130,781, covering 4,230,379
individuals. 3,020,766 individuals have completed the full vaccination
