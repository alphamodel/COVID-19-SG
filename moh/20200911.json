The remaining cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing. This allows us to pick up cases in the dormitory early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.</p>", "PressCategory": ["Highlights", "Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "87-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-11sep", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
