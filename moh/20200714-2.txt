347 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 14 Jul 2020

               As of 14 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
has preliminarily confirmed an additional 347 cases of COVID-19
infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit
holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Based on our
investigations so far, there are 7 cases in the community, of whom 1 is
a Singaporean and 6 are Work Pass holders. In addition, there are 2
imported cases who had been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in
Singapore.
2.            We have to date tested and cleared more than 215,000
workers (or two-thirds of those living in dormitories). Work is ongoing
to prepare these dormitories to be declared cleared, and for workers to
resume work. We are on track to clear about 80% of workers staying in
the dormitories by end-July, and to complete the testing of dormitory
residents around mid-August.
3.            In the next few days, we have a larger population of
migrant workers in various purpose-built dormitories completing their
isolation period and being tested for COVID-19. As some of them came
from dormitories with higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection, we can
expect a higher number of confirmed cases in the next few days from this
group of migrant workers.
4.            We are still working through the details of the cases
today, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that
will be issued tonight.
