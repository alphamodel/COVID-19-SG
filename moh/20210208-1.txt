increased from 3 cases in the week before to 4 cases in the past week.
The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from 2
cases in the week before to 4 cases in the past week. We will continue
to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through
our surveillance programme.

to 8 February, 84 cases have tested positive for their serology tests,
32 have tested negative, and 40 serology test results are pending.

CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2

There are 2 cases in the community today who are currently unlinked.

Case 60051

Case 60051 is a 49 year-old male Singaporean who works as a bus driver
employed by Cobb & Coach Services Pte Ltd. His job includes transporting
individuals placed on SHN from Changi Airport to dedicated SHN
facilities. His bus is disinfected after every trip.

He developed a runny nose on 31 January but did not seek medical
attention. He was subsequently detected when he was tested on 5 February
as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came
back positive for COVID-19 on 6 February, and an individual test was
done later that night at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. His test result came
back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and he was conveyed in
an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His
earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 23 January – were negative
for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative,
indicating that this is likely a current infection.

Case 60052

Case 60052 is a 30 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass
holder, and works as an engineer at Station Satcom Pte Ltd. As part of
his job, he boards ships to install communications and IT equipment.

He had earlier been identified as a close contact of Case 59208[1], and
was placed on quarantine from 13 January to 24 January. His swabs taken
during quarantine on 13 January and 21 January were negative for
COVID-19. Subsequent tests done as part of RRT – the last being on 29
January – were also negative for COVID-19.

He developed fatigue on 4 February, and a fever the next day but did not
seek medical attention. On 5 February, he was tested for COVID-19 as
part of RRT. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection
the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. While his
serological test taken on 7 February has come back positive, this is
assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value
for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low.

Case 60052 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine on 27 January, which accounts for his positive serology test as
he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. As the
vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been infected due
to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or
just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an
individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by
them.

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
