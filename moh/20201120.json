This also applies to travellers entering Singapore to work under the Periodic Commuting Arrangement and returning Singapore-based travellers under the Singapore \u2013 Malaysia Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL).&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, travellers who are not SCs or PRs, and who have recent travel history to <strong>Malaysia</strong> within the last 14 days prior to entry will be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure. Travellers will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result as a condition of approval to enter Singapore. This requirement will take effect for those arriving in Singapore from <strong>27 November 2020, 2359 hours</strong>. This requirement will not apply for returning Singapore-based travellers under the Singapore \u2013 Malaysia RGL.<br><br><strong>Travellers from Japan to serve 14-Day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities<br></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As there has been a sharp increase in cases in Japan in the past week, all travellers entering Singapore from <strong>22 November 2020, 2359 hours</strong> who have a travel history to <strong>Japan</strong> in the past 14 days will be required to serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. These travellers will no longer be able to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, even if they have obtained approval to opt out earlier. The 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities also applies to returning Singapore-based travellers under the Singapore \u2013 Japan RGL.<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is revised from our announcement on 27 October 2020 that travellers from Japan were allowed to opt out of serving their 14-day SHN at a dedicated SHN facility if they had a suitable place of residence.&nbsp;<br><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Travellers from Fiji, Finland, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey will continue to be allowed to apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:&nbsp;<br><br>a. Travelled to no other country/ region than above-mentioned countries [1], in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and&nbsp;<br> <br>b. Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.&nbsp;<br><br>The COVID-19 tests will continue to be administered before the end of the SHN.<br><br><strong>Regular Review of Border Measures<br></strong><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community.
