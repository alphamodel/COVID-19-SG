338 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 291 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 27 Jun 2020

1.      As of 27 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 291 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A)      IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B)      CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 11 (5 Singaporeans, 2 Work Pass holders,
4 Work Permit holders)
Of the 11 cases in the community,  5 had been picked up as a result of
our proactive surveillance and screening, and 5 had already been placed
on quarantine earlier.
Amongst the 5 Singaporean cases, 3 (Cases 43261, 43262 and 43263) are
from a family cluster. They were contacts of a previously confirmed case
who had been tested as he works at a dormitory. All 3 cases had already
been quarantined, and were swabbed during quarantine to verify their
status. Another case (Case 43278) was detected due to our proactive
surveillance of persons working at dormitories, even though he is
asymptomatic. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the
remaining case (Case 43099).
Amongst the 6 Work Pass/ Work Permit holders, 2 (Cases 43100 and 43146¹)
had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had
already been quarantined earlier. They were swabbed during quarantine to
verify their status. The remaining 4 cases (Cases 43228, 43229, 43264
and 43280) were detected as part of our screening of workers in
essential services.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 6 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 3 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
With more activities resuming in Phase Two, it is critical that we
continue to exercise caution to keep the number of new cases under
control. All of us must adhere to safe management principles.
Irresponsible behaviour that disregards the spirit of the rule to limit
social gatherings to not more than 5 persons endangers others, and may
lead to the formation of large infection clusters. We urge everyone to
continue to exercise personal responsibility and not put the community
at risk. We take a serious view of such breaches and will not hesitate
to take actions against individuals who breach the rules.
C)      CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 280
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.      Details of these trends can be found in MOH's daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 97% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.      MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to 564 A-E
Balestier Road for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the
cluster has now been closed.
5.      We have completed a round of surveillance tests for
non-residential community staff including staff from kidney dialysis
centres, home care and senior care centres. Out of more than 5,700 staff
tested, all were tested negative with the exception of one staff who had
been announced on 26 June.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
6.      In the past week (20 June to 26 June), MOH has uncovered links
for 7 previously unlinked cases.
7.      Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
8.      338 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 37,163 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
9.      There are currently 174 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 5,883 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 26 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
10.      Case 38238, a 27 year-old male Bangladeshi national, has passed
away on 25 June 2020. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 6
June. The cause of death was multiple injuries consistent with those
resulting from a fall from height².

[1] Case 43146 is part of the family cluster with the other 3
Singaporean cases (Cases 43261, 43262 and 43263) today.
[2] Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the
primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will
be added to the COVID-19 death count. This is consistent with
international practice for classifying deaths.
