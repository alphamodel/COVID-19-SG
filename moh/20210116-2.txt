Updates On Border Measures and Travel Insurance



UPDATES ON BORDER MEASURES AND TRAVEL INSURANCE


Published Date: 16 Jan 2021

        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce regularly reviews Singapore’s
border measures to manage the risk of importation and onward local
transmission from travellers. Given the resurgence of COVID-19 cases
around the world, we will be putting in place more stringent measures
for travellers to manage the risk of importation.
On-arrival Testing for Travellers
2.        We currently require travellers who are not Singapore Citizens
(SCs) or Permanent Residents (PRs), and who have recent travel history
to high-risk countries/ regions, to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure. These travellers
are then required to serve their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in
Singapore, and they are tested at the end of their SHN.
3.       Given the emergence of new virus variants and the worsening
COVID-19 situation around the world, we will put in place additional
border control measures for all travellers. In particular, FROM 24
JANUARY 2021, 2359 HOURS, ALL TRAVELLERS (INCLUDING SCS AND PRS) WILL
NEED TO TAKE A COVID-19 PCR TEST UPON ARRIVAL IN SINGAPORE¹. The
prevailing SHN requirements, including the PCR test at the end of the
SHN, will continue.
Further Precautions for Travellers from the United Kingdom and South
Africa
4.      We had earlier restricted entry and transit for all long-term
pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to the
UK and South Africa. This arose from concerns of a more contagious
variant of the COVID-19 virus circulating in these countries.
5.      As a further precaution, from 18 January 2021, 2359 hours, until
further notice, all returning SCs and PRs from the UK and South Africa
will be subject to an additional 7-day self-isolation at their place of
residence, following their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. The
returnees from the UK and South Africa will be tested at the end of
their SHN (as per the current requirement), and again after they have
completed their 7-day self-isolation period. These further precautions
will apply to travellers who are currently serving their SHN.

INSURANCE COVERAGE
6.        Currently, short-term visitors entering Singapore under the
Air Travel Pass (ATP) and Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs) are required to
bear the full costs of medical treatment, should they be suspected of
being infected with COVID-19 or require medical treatment for COVID-19
while in Singapore.
7.        With effect from 31 JANUARY 2021, 2359 HOURS, VISITORS
APPLYING TO ENTER SINGAPORE UNDER THE ATP AND RGLS WILL NEED TO HAVE
TRAVEL INSURANCE FOR THEIR COVID-19-RELATED MEDICAL TREATMENT AND
HOSPITALISATION COSTS IN SINGAPORE, WITH A MINIMUM COVERAGE OF S$30,000.
The travel insurance will help them pay for the costs of their medical
treatment in Singapore. The visitors can purchase the travel insurance
from Singapore-based or overseas insurers. A list of available insurance
products can be found at the SafeTravel website.
LOOKING AHEAD TO FURTHER REOPENING
8.         As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust
our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission
to the community. The Ministry of Health will also continue to review
the data and evidence on any new viral strains and update the measures
accordingly.
9.     Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel
website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the
most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared
to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including
payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and
treatment.
10.   We seek the continued cooperation of all Singaporeans to remain
united and disciplined in our fight against COVID-19.
