</strong><br>
<strong><br>a) Cases in the community: 2
</strong><br>
<br>There are 2 cases in the community today who are currently unlinked. 
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Case 59028
<br>
</span><br>Case 59028, a 24 year-old male Korean national, is a Work Permit holder who works at Azur at Crowne Plaza Changi Airport (75 Airport Boulevard). His job entails delivering pre-packed meals to air crew and hotel guests. He does not interact with diners at Azur. 
<br>
<br>He tested positive for a pooled swab during Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) on 2 January, and was tested again on 4 January. On the same day, he started to develop acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. His individual test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 5 January, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. He has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests. 
<br>
<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Case 59034
</span><br>
<br>Case 59034 is a 31 year-old male Filipino who arrived from the Philippines on 4 December, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 18 December. His pre-departure test taken in the Philippines on 1 December was negative for COVID-19 infection, and his test on 14 December during SHN came back negative as well.
<br>
<br>He is a Work Permit holder who is employed by Singapore General Hospital (SGH), but has not started work yet. As part of his pre-employment health screening, he was tested for COVID-19 on 5 January even though he is asymptomatic, and his test came back positive. He was subsequently conveyed to SGH in an ambulance. His serological test result has come back positive, which indicates a likely past infection.
<br>
<br>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them
