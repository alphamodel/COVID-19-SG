from 4 cases in the week before to 3 cases in the past week. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at 2 cases per
week in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these
numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance
programme.
3.            Amongst the 98 confirmed cases reported from 26 February
to 4 March, 39 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 30
have tested negative, and 29 serology test results are pending.

CASE DETAILS

A)            CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to a previous case.
Case 60626
Case 60626 is an 81 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of
Case 60588[1], and a retiree.
She developed a fever and chills on 27 February but did not seek medical
attention, and recovered on the same day. However Case 60626 received
her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 26 February, and these symptoms
might also have been due to the vaccination. As she had been identified
as a close contact of Case 60588, she was placed on quarantine on 2
March, and was tested for COVID-19 as part of our protocol to test
individuals during quarantine. Her test result came back positive for
COVID-19 infection the next day, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to
the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Her serological test
result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current
infection.
As the vaccine does not contain live virus, Case 60626 could not have
been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected
just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks
for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including her family members,
have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the
start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close
contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.

B)            CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C)            IMPORTED CASES: 18
 Amongst the 18 imported cases,
•             3 (Cases 60625, 60628 and 60635) are Singaporeans and 1
(Case 60631) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from Ghana,
India, Indonesia and the US.
•             1 (Case 60624) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from

60622, 60636, 60637 and 60641) are foreign domestic workers.
•             1 (Case 60644) is a Student's Pass holder who arrived from
the US for studies in Singapore.
•             1 (Case 60633) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who
