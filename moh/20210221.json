In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them. <br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are investigating a Malaysian truck driver who works as a freelance deliveryman and was denied entry into Singapore on 18 February after testing positive for COVID-19 for an antigen rapid test (ART) at Woodlands Checkpoint. His polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 19 February. His previous trip to Singapore was on 8 February, when he tested negative for COVID-19 for his ART at the Checkpoint. Our investigations found that he had visited Resorts World Sentosa Casino on 9 February before departing for Malaysia on the same day. While he is not included in the case count as he had not been allowed entry into Singapore after his positive ART test, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure, including placing all identified close contacts on quarantine. <br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; Malaysian truck drivers are not allowed to mingle in the community other than for delivery purposes and are not to stay overnight. Investigations are ongoing to assess if there had been any breach of the relevant prevailing measures.</p><p><p><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases&nbsp;<br><br></strong>8.&nbsp;<strong> &nbsp;</strong>12 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,731 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities. <br><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are currently 22 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 87 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
