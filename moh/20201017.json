The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<p><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the new cases, 33% are imported or linked to known cases/ clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.</p></p><p><p><strong></strong><strong>Case Details</strong></p><p><strong>a) Cases in the community: 1</strong></p></p><p>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 58068 is a migrant worker who is currently unemployed. He was detected as a result of our requirement for routine testing of Special Pass holders, even though he is asymptomatic. His serological test result has come back positive, which indicates likely past infection.</p><p><p><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 1</strong></p><p>There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today. He was detected through our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts. </p><p><strong>c) Imported cases: 1</strong></p><p>There is 1 imported case today. Case 58067 is a Singaporean who returned from Indonesia. She had been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and was tested while serving SHN. </p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).</p></p><p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.</p></p><p><p><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></p><p>6.<b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
