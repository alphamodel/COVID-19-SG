246 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 170 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 11 Jul 2020

  As of 11 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 170 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

A)  IMPORTED CASES: 1 (1 Work Pass holder)

There is an imported case today involving an Indian national who
returned to Singapore from India on 6 July. She is a Work Pass holder
who is currently employed in Singapore. She had been placed on 14-day
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested
while serving SHN.

B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 24 (7 Singaporeans, 6 Work Pass
holders, 11 Work Permit holders)

Of the 24 cases in the community, 19 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 5 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. 20 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were all
detected through our proactive testing.

15 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or
clusters. Of these, 5 (Cases 45702, 45771, 45779, 45781 and 45821) had
been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been
tested during their quarantine to determine their status. The rest of
the cases were detected through our proactive testing, even though they
are all asymptomatic. 9 of them were swabbed as they work in essential
services, and the remaining case (Case 45672) was tested as part of our
efforts to screen individuals working in frontline COVID-19 operations.

9 of the community cases are currently unlinked. All of them are
asymptomatic, and were identified from our periodic screening of workers
in essential services who are living outside the dormitories.

Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to
determine if these cases could have been infected by them.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 19 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 9 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 145

We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.  Of the new cases, 94% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

4.  In the past week (4 July to 10 July), MOH has uncovered
links for 5 previously unlinked cases.

5.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

6.  246 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 42,026 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

7.  There are currently 192 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 3,539 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 26 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
