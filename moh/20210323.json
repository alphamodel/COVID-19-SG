She returned to Singapore on 2 March 2021, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 16 March. Both her on-arrival test on 2 March, as well as her swab done on 15 March during SHN, were negative for COVID-19. She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 20 March in preparation for a trip to Indonesia. Her test result came back positive on 22 March, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Her Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and her serology test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported based on her travel history. She is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annexes-(1).pdf?sfvrsn=2c8fbacb_0\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details. <br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them. <br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Low levels of COVID-19 viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) were detected on 21 March from the National Environment Agency\u2019s testing of wastewater sample collected on 20 March from the UTown Residence North Tower at the National University of Singapore. There is evidence to suggest that this may be due to viral shedding from a recovered past infection amongst the residents, but as a precautionary measure, MOH carried out a special testing operations today to test residents of the affected apartments. In total, 437 individuals, excluding the recovered case, have been swabbed for COVID-19 during the testing operations, and all the results are currently pending.</span></p></p><p><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases&nbsp;<br><br></strong>7.&nbsp;<strong> &nbsp;</strong>12 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
