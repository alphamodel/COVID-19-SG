UPDATES ON BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS


Published Date: 05 Sep 2021

        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the
global COVID-19 situation and regularly reviews Singapore’s border
measures to manage the risk of importation from travellers and onward
local transmission. We will be extending and updating our pre-departure
testing requirement for all travellers from Category II, III and IV
countries/regions. We will also be updating our border measures for
travellers from a number of countries/ regions. The updated border
measures would apply to all travellers from the identified
countries/regions arriving from 9 SEPTEMBER 2021, 2359 HOURS.

UPDATED PRE-DEPARTURE TEST REQUIREMENT FOR INBOUND TRAVELLERS

travellers (including Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) from
Category III and IV countries/regions to produce a negative COVID-19
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result taken within 72 hours before
departure to Singapore to enter or transit through Singapore. From 9
