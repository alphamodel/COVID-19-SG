      As of 23 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has

Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 13 (5 Permanent Residents, 2 Work Permit holders, 2
Student’s Pass holders, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder, 1 Long-Term Visit
Pass holder, 2 Short-Term Visit Pass holders)
Amongst the 13 imported cases, 5 (Cases 56399, 56400, 56401, 56402 and
56403) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from
India on 11 August. 2 (Cases 56396 and 56397) are Dependant’s Pass and
Long-Term Visit Pass holders who arrived from India and the Philippines
on 11 August. 2 (Cases 56374 and 56375) are Work Permit holders
currently employed in Singapore who arrived from the Philippines on 11
August. Another 2 (Cases 56373 and 56404) are Student’s Pass holders who
arrived from India on 11 August. The remaining 2 (Cases 56369 and 56408)
are Short-Term Visit Pass holders who were allowed entry into Singapore
as 1 has been seeking medical treatment in Singapore and the other is
the parent and caregiver. They arrived from Bangladesh on 21 August.
All the cases had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated
facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Work Pass holder)
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
56372 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to
identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further
spread.
Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for his household contacts to
determine if he could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 73
The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in
the dormitories. There are currently about 13,500 workers who are still
serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when
their quarantine ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in
the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.
