UPDATE ON VACCINATION PROGRESS

     As of 10 August 2021, we have administered a total of 8,193,151
doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme
(Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty and Moderna), covering 4,383,631 individuals,
with 3,936,162 individuals having completed the full vaccination
regimen. In addition, 138,879 doses of other vaccines recognised in the
World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been
administered as of 10 August 2021, covering 82,406 individuals. In
total, 72% of our population has completed their full regimen/ received
two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 81% has received at least one dose.

CONDITION OF HOSPITALISED CASES

2.     508 cases are currently warded in hospital. There are currently
35 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 8 in
critical condition in the ICU. 7 amongst these 43 cases are fully
vaccinated. Of those who have fallen very ill, 36 are seniors above 60
years, of whom 29 are completely unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.

3.     Case 66910, a 69 year-old male Singaporean, has passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection on 11 August 2021. He had
developed symptoms on 28 July, and was admitted to Tan Tock Seng
Hospital on 29 July where he tested positive for COVID-19 infection. He
had not been vaccinated against COVID-19, and had a history of stroke,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. In total, 43 have
passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.

4.     There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 8.7%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 0.9%.

[1] Based on National Immunisation Registry data.

[2] Full regimen refers to individuals who have received both doses of
the vaccine or one dose for vaccinated recovered individuals.

[3] Other vaccines recognised in the WHO EUL account for about 2% of the
total population who received at least 1 dose and about 1% of total
population who completed the full regimen.

[4] Fully vaccinated - more than 14 days after completing vaccination
regimen (both doses of the vaccine or one dose for recovered
individuals). Partially vaccinated – received 1 dose of 2-dose vaccine
or COVID-positive within 14 days of completing vaccination regimen.

[5] Incorporates re-classifications of earlier reported cases.

[6] Includes new cases added today.
