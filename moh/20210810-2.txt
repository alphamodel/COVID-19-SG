(Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty and Moderna), covering 4,373,550
individuals, with 3,897,650 individuals having completed the full
vaccination regimen. In addition, 131,186 doses of other vaccines

32 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 11 in
critical condition in the ICU. 6 amongst these 43 cases are fully
vaccinated. Of those who have fallen very ill, 35 are seniors above 60

3.      There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 8.4%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 0.8%.
