The higher number of cases today is mainly due to fewer tests being conducted by the COVID-19 testing laboratories over the public holiday and weekend on 10 July and 11 July, with the backlog of samples being cleared from 12 July. The number of cases reported for 9 July and before were not affected. The breakdown of the cases today is as follows:</p><p><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Imported cases: 5 </strong>(2 Permanent Residents, 2 Work Pass holders, 1 Dependant\u2019s Pass holder)</p><p>Amongst the 5 imported cases, 2 (Cases 46217 and 46258) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India on 6 July and from Pakistan on 20 June respectively. Another 2 cases (Cases 46212 and 46214) are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in Singapore. They arrived in Singapore from the Philippines on 30 June. The remaining case (Case 46213) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who returned to Singapore from the USA on 30 June. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN.</p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Cases in the community: 11 </strong>(2 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 6 Work Pass holders, 3 Work Permit holders)</p><p>4 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters. Of these, 2 (Cases 46218 and 46291) had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been tested during their quarantine to determine their status, even though they are asymptomatic. Another case (Case 46374) was swabbed as he works in essential services. The remaining case (Case 46254) was tested as part of our efforts to screen individuals working in frontline COVID-19 operations.</p><p>7 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 6 (Cases 46248, 46249, 46250, 46251, 46252 and 46253) are asymptomatic, and were identified from our periodic screening of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories. The remaining case (Case 46017) was tested for COVID-19 after he sought treatment for symptoms.</p><p>Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to determine if these cases could have been infected by them.</p><p>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 12 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 14 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of 6 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 8 per day in the past week.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Cases residing in dormitories: 306</strong></p><p>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

As there were non-compliances observed, MOH has directed that the workplace be closed for a period of 14 days, from 13 July to 26 July (inclusive), under Section 19 of the Infectious Diseases Act to prevent further spread at the workplace. The closure will allow the company to review and tighten its safe management measures. Close contacts of the cases had been placed on quarantine earlier, and all its employees will also be placed under health surveillance and tested for COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past week (6 July to 12 July), MOH has uncovered links for 6 previously unlinked cases.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

The National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) have introduced a personal guide to the 1-hour average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to help individuals decide on their immediate outdoor activities during the haze season. The personal guide is now available on the haze microsite (<a href=\"http://www.haze.gov.sg/\">www.haze.gov.sg</a>) and the myENV app. <br><br><strong>Using the 1-hr PM2.5 Concentration for Immediate/Current Activities </strong><br><br>2. The 1-hr PM2.5 concentration is the average concentration of PM2.5, in micrograms per cubic metre (\u00b5g/m3), measured in the air over the past hour. Since 2014, NEA has been publishing the 1-hr PM2.5 concentration readings on an hourly basis across the five regions in Singapore. The 1-hr PM2.5 concentration is a useful indication of the current air quality. In 2016, NEA introduced bandings and descriptors to help the public interpret the 1-hr PM2.5 concentration readings. <br><br>3. MOH and NEA are now making available a personal guide to the 1-hr PM2.5 concentration level that the public can refer to when deciding on their immediate activities, such as going for a walk or run (see <a title=\"Annex A\" href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-a-(pm25).pdf?sfvrsn=e2f751f5_0\">Annex A</a>). The 1-hr PM2.5 concentration levels can be volatile and can fluctuate over the day due to weather conditions, especially during periods of transboundary haze. When planning activities within the same day, members of the public are advised to closely monitor the 1-hr PM2.5 readings and check the latest readings before proceeding. <br><br>4. The public are advised to consider their own individual health and physical conditions when using the personal guide. This is because each individual\u2019s reaction to pollutants may vary, and the amount of physical exertion that can be performed differs. For the general population, symptoms that may arise from short-term exposure to PM2.5, such as throat or eye irritations, are expected to resolve after withdrawing from the exposure. <br><br><strong>Using the 24-hr PSI Forecast for Future Activities </strong><br><br>5. To plan for the next day\u2019s activities or events, individuals and organisations should continue to refer to the 24-hr PSI forecast and accompanying health advisory. The 24-hr PSI is a rolling average of the PSI readings over the past 24 hours. Since 2013, during the Southwest Monsoon months when there is likelihood of transboundary haze affecting Singapore, NEA has been publishing a forecast of the 24-hr PSI for the next 24 hours accompanied with a corresponding health advisory. The forecast is based on NEA\u2019s assessment of the air quality, weather conditions, hotspot and haze situation in the region. <br><br>6. The Government\u2019s Haze Task Force comprising 28 government agencies and led by NEA will continue to use the 24-hr PSI forecast to implement action plans to minimise and manage the impact of haze on Singapore, guide risk assessment of immediate activities and advise major decisions such as school closure and suspension of training or outdoor work. <br><br>7. Singapore\u2019s air quality readings are taken from a network of air quality monitoring stations across the island. Current air quality readings, including the forecast range for the 24-hr PSI, as well as NEA\u2019s daily haze advisory<sup>1</sup> are available on NEA\u2019s website (www.nea.gov.sg), the haze microsite (www.haze.gov.sg), NEA\u2019s Facebook (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/NEASingapore\">www.facebook.com/NEASingapore</a>) and Twitter (@NEAsg), and the myENV app.<br><br>[1] Forecast air quality readings and NEA\u2019s daily haze advisory are only available during periods of transboundary haze.<br><br><strong>NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY AND MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>13 JULY 2020</strong>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "new-personal-guide-based-on-1-hr-pm2.5-concentration-readings-to-guide-the-public-during-haze-season", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
