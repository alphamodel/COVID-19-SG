    <title>Resetting Our Measures  to Live With the Omicron Variant</title>
    <body><h1>Resetting Our Measures  to Live With the Omicron Variant</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 16 Feb 2022</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; We are in the midst of an Omicron wave, and seeing up to about 20,000 daily cases. This is within our expectations, given the high transmissibility of Omicron. However, our high vaccination and booster rates, along with vaccination-differentiated Safe Management Measures (SMMs), have been effective in keeping the number of severe cases low, and our healthcare capacity available to treat the severely ill currently remains sufficient.&nbsp;<br><br>2. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">In the coming weeks, daily case numbers may rise even further before peaking, and may remain moderately high for some time before coming down. We will continue to closely monitor the capacity of our healthcare system, and prepare for further surges in infections. During this period, our strategy remains to safeguard our healthcare capacity and focus resources on managing severe cases and protecting vulnerable patients. In line with this, we will continue to suspend in-person visits to hospitals and residential care homes for an additional four weeks.<br><br>3. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">We will also further simplify our existing healthcare protocols, workplace testing requirements, and SMMs, so that everyone can understand the rules, focus on the measures that matter, and do our part in making sure our measures remain effective:<br></span></p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">a. &nbsp;More age groups of patients to be managed by primary care physicians under Protocol 2 if they exhibit mild symptoms;&nbsp;<br><br>b. &nbsp;Shorter monitoring duration and simplified testing requirements for those under Protocol 3 (i.e. close contacts of COVID-19 cases);<br> <br>c. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Focusing the Mandatory Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) on sectors where there are interactions with vulnerable population as well as the provision of essential services;&nbsp;<br><br>d. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Streamlining the SMMs to a</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;set of five core parameters, so that it will be easier for everyone to comply with them on a daily basis; and&nbsp;<br><br>e. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Simplifying our country/region classification and streamlining our border testing measures given the reduced impact of imported cases</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><br></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">4. &nbsp;These measures will allow us to respond nimbly to changes in the pandemic situation in the coming months, including to&nbsp;&nbsp;ease measures when the Omicron wave eventually subside, or tighten up should there be another unknown new variant.&nbsp;<br><strong><br>Updates on Local Situation<br><br></strong>5. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Over the past week, daily case numbers have remained high, at an average of around 11,000 cases. The large majority of our cases continue to have mild or no symptoms. The number of cases which are hospitalised is around 1,400, of which about 30% are ‘incidental cases’, (i.e. they were hospitalised due to other illness but subsequently tested to be COVID-19 positive).&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, hospitals are also increasing bed capacity to care for severe COVID-19 cases, while ensuring that care for non-COVID-19 patients are not compromised. About 70 of our hospitalised patients are children under 12 years old. The infection rates for children aged 0 to 4 years and those aged 5 to 11 years are currently high at about 243 and 258 per 100,000 population respectively. Individuals aged 12 to 19 years have the highest infection rate of about 269 per 100,000 population.<br><br>6. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Aside from standing up more beds for children in our public and private hospitals, we are also actively converting beds in our COVID-19 Treatment Facilities for children and their caregivers. The proportion of severe COVID-19 infections and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children associated with COVID-19 infection (MIS-C) cases is around 1 out of 1,000 paediatric infection cases. Vaccination of children will help lower the risk of such episodes.&nbsp;<br><br>7. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">The overall situation in our healthcare system remains stable. 23 cases are currently in ICU care, and 140 require oxygen supplementation. In the past 28 days, 0.04% and 0.3% of local cases required ICU care or oxygen supplementation respectively.&nbsp;<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Continued Efforts to Safeguard our Healthcare System and Right-Site Patients</strong></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u>Extended Suspension of In-Person Visits to Hospitals and Residential Care Homes&nbsp;</u><br><u></u><br>8. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">We had previously suspended in-person visits to all hospital wards[1]</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;and residential care homes (‘Homes’) for a period of four weeks through to 20 February 2022. As it remains crucial that we protect our healthcare capacity and vulnerable groups, the suspension of in-persons visits will be extended for a further four weeks,&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">from 21 February to 20 March 2022 (both dates inclusive)</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">, with a mid-point review after two weeks. Hospitals and Homes have the discretion to allow visits for exceptional cases (e.g. if the patient or resident is critically ill). These visitors will continue to be subject to visitor management measures (see&nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-ad14e30709e1540abaefc632617a1bbd1.pdf?sfvrsn=2c5b700a_0" title="Annex A">Annex A</a></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;for details). Hospitals and Homes will also continue to support alternative methods of communication such as through telephone or video calls to ensure that patients and residents remain connected with their loved ones.&nbsp;</span></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">In-situ Recovery for Selected Nursing Home Residents</u></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">9. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Currently, nursing home residents infected with COVID-19 are moved from the nursing homes to recover at separate care facilities. However, the majority of Omicron cases in nursing homes were mildly symptomatic and generally did not require the level of medical care provided at hospitals or dedicated COVID-19 care facilities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Also, moving away from a familiar environment can be distressing to nursing home residents and disruptive to their holistic care.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Hence,<strong>&nbsp;from 16 February 2022,</strong>&nbsp;the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) will progressively support nursing homes to care for their fully vaccinated COVID-19 residents who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic within their premises, but isolated from the other uninfected residents. This will allow generally well residents with COVID-19 infection to recover safely under the care of their nursing home provider who is also most familiar with their needs. Residents assessed to be at higher risk, or who show signs of clinical deterioration, will continue to be conveyed to an appropriate care facility for further management.</span></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Revised Healthcare Protocols&nbsp;</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><strong><em></em></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u>Expanded Application of Protocol 2 to More Patient Groups</u><br><br>10. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Among patients infected since January 2022</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">, the vast majority from most age groups have mild symptoms and can recover safely on their own. Even amongst the seniors, the incidence of severe illnesses have been low.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, amongst seniors aged 60 to 69 years who were infected, only about 0.5% of fully vaccinated and 1.8% of non-fully vaccinated patients were treated as severe cases. Amongst vaccinated seniors aged 70 to 79 years, 1.2% fell severely ill after being infected. 4.5% of 3 to 4-year olds who attended Emergency Departments (EDs) required admission and less than 1% of them on Home Recovery Programme were escalated to the telemedicine providers for further management.<br><br>11. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Hence,&nbsp;<strong>from 16 February 2022,</strong>&nbsp;all patients aged 3 to 69 years, regardless of vaccination status, and fully vaccinated[2]</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;patients aged 70 to 79 years old can be managed by their primary care doctors under Protocol 2[3]</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. This is an expansion of the current age band, which&nbsp;applies to fully vaccinated patients aged 5 to 69 years, and non-fully vaccinated patients aged 5 to 49 years. Patients falling outside of these age brackets will continue to be managed by MOH, either through the Home Recovery Programme or at a care facility such as a COVID-19 Treatment Facility or a hospital. This will further right-site the care of COVID-19 patients and ensure that our healthcare capacity is preserved for those who require acute care.&nbsp;A summary of the revised management approach for COVID-19 patients for different age groups is in&nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-b0a917fe44e6740099f43204549ec34dc.pdf?sfvrsn=64f63f31_0" title="Annex B">Annex B</a></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.</span></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">12. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">With the above changes, individuals under Protocol 2 with non-emergency conditions, including children, are strongly advised to avoid seeking treatment at the EDs of hospitals and to consult their primary care doctors or telemedicine providers should they require any medical assistance. Individuals with non-emergency conditions turning up at EDs may be diverted to other urgent care clinics for further assessment, so as to prioritise ED resources for patients requiring acute care. Individuals may also be diverted for admission to COVID-19 Treatment Facilities for further monitoring of their medical condition, as long as they do not require hospitalisation.<br><br></span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u>Changes to Protocol 3 for Close Contacts&nbsp;</u><br><br>13. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Currently, close contacts of positive cases identified by MOH (i.e. under Protocol 1 or Protocol 2 managed by primary care doctors) are placed on Protocol 3. These individuals are issued with a Health Risk Warning (HRW) lasting 7 days from the day of its issuance, with an ART-based daily self-testing regime imposed should they wish to leave their place of residence. However, close contacts of cases who self-test positive (i.e. under Protocol 2) are not able to be identified and are thus not issued the HRW. &nbsp;<br><br>14. &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Therefore from</span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;18 February 2022,</strong><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;we will introduce&nbsp;</span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">two key changes to Protocol 3</strong><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it will be changed from an order to an advisory, with the Health Risk Notice (HRN) replacing the Health Risk Warning (HRW) for close contacts identified by MOH under Protocol 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons issued with HRN can continue to obtain their ART test kits through designated vending machines, to facilitate their self-testing during the monitoring period[4]</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the recommended self-monitoring period will be reduced from 7 days to 5 days, as individuals infected with the Omicron variant have been shown to have a shorter incubation period. That said, those who have already received HRWs should still complete their existing monitoring periods[5]</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. &nbsp;<br><br>15. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Regardless of whether one receives a HRN from MOH, all persons who are aware of their recent exposure to a case should be socially responsible and follow Protocol 3. They should moderate their social activities, monitor their health and self-test with ART before leaving home for that day, especially if they are going to crowded places or are coming into contact with vulnerable individuals.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Streamlining the Rostered Routine Testing Regime&nbsp;<br><br></strong><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">16. &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) was first introduced in dormitories and higher risk workplaces in August 2020. Over time, we have expanded it to cover more higher-risk work settings[6]</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">, and shifted towards an ART-based RRT.&nbsp;<br><br>17. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">The RRT regime had served as an important part of our strategy to facilitate early detection and containment of transmission in the community. Testing continues to be an essential response to COVID-19. However, we are in a different situation today and our testing strategy needs to evolve. Our high vaccination coverage and the implementation of Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) offer good protection to the workforce from severe disease due to COVID-19 infection. The high transmissibility and shorter incubation period of the Omicron variant have also meant a reduction in the effectiveness of RRT in containing community transmission. Furthermore, we have shifted our focus towards protecting the vulnerable population and managing severe cases.<br><br>18. &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Therefore,&nbsp;<strong>from 18 February 2022</strong>, we will&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">streamline the RRT regime to focus only on settings catering to vulnerable groups (i.e.&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">healthcare sector, eldercare sector, and settings with children below 5 years old[7]) and selected essential services sectors[8],[9]</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. Other sectors which are currently on RRT will no longer be required to continue testing from 18 February 2022.<br><br>19. &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Even as we move to streamline RRT to those in vulnerable settings, w<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">e urge individuals to continue to exercise personal responsibility and conduct regular self-testing,&nbsp;</span>especially prior to visiting crowded places or interacting with vulnerable groups during this period.&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Companies that have remaining kits that were already distributed to them for RRT are strongly encouraged to continue testing until the test kits are fully utilised</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.<br><br></span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><b>Updates on Community Safe Management Measures&nbsp;</b><br><br>20. </span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">As we continue to transition to a COVID-19 resilient nation, we will simplify and rationalise our COVID-19 rules, which have accumulated over time and become overly complex. &nbsp;<br><br>21. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">This rationalisation and simplification is important. Responding to COVID-19 requires everyone to do their part. We can facilitate this by making rules less complicated and burdensome to remember. This will also lay the foundation for us to resume normal activities once the Omicron wave peaks and starts to subside.&nbsp;<br><br>22. &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">We will rationalise the SMMs to&nbsp;</span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">focus on the five most important and effective measures,</strong><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;making them simpler to understand and comply with: &nbsp;</span></p></p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">a. &nbsp;Group sizes;<br>b. &nbsp;Mask-wearing;<br>c. &nbsp;Workplace requirements;<br>d. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Safe distancing; and<br>e. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Capacity limits.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">23. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">From&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">25 February 2022 (unless otherwise stated below)</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">, we will implement the following streamlined SMMs (see&nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-ce72b7c0175df44e4a0824fa82abf798c.pdf?sfvrsn=ddf43869_0" title="Annex C">Annex C</a></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">). More details are provided in the sections as follows.&nbsp;</span></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u>Group Sizes</u><br><br>24. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">For now, the permissible group size for social gatherings remains at 5 persons. The maximum number of unique visitors per household will be adjusted from 5 persons&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u>per day</u></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">, to 5 persons&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u>at any one time</u></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. &nbsp;</span></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u>Mask-Wearing</u><br><br>25. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Mask-wearing will continue to be required as a default. There are no new exceptions.&nbsp;</span></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u></u></span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Workplace Requirements</u></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">26. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">We will maintain the current posture of allowing up to 50% of employees who can work from home to return to the office. As part of the streamlining of rules, workplace requirements will now be aligned with those for the community SMMs. For instance, workers who have their masks on will not need to maintain 1 metre safe distancing in the workplace. Social gatherings at workplaces will be allowed to resume with up to 5 persons for each social gathering. There will be no restrictions on cross-deployment of employees across workplaces, although employers may continue to do so for business continuity reasons.&nbsp;</span></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Safe Distancing</u></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">27. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Safe distancing is encouraged but will&nbsp;<strong>not be required&nbsp;</strong></span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">between individuals or&nbsp;&nbsp;groups</strong><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;in all mask-on settings</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. Safe distancing will&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">continue to be required for all mask-off settings</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. Where safe distancing is required, the distance will be streamlined to a single safe distance of 1 metre for all settings.</span></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Capacity Limits&nbsp;</u></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">28. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Instead of fixing size limits for various event types, we will move to setting event sizes based on the capacity of the venue. Hence,&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">from 4 March 2022</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">, we will lift specific event size limits for events such as religious services, business events, media conferences, funerary memorial events, wedding receptions, and mask-on classes[10]</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoning requirements will also be removed, as the main protection is through masks and vaccinations. &nbsp;</span></p></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">29. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">However, for large events and settings which pose more infection risks, we will impose capacity limits, as a precaution. These will include attractions, cruises, MICE and large work-related events, as well as large performing arts venues or sports stadiums. For other settings such as shopping malls and large standalone stores, the current density limit of 10sqm/pax roughly translates to 50% capacity too. For now, we will set the threshold at 1,000 pax. This means that:</span></p></p><p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">a. &nbsp;For smaller settings/events with ≤1,000 pax, they can proceed without being subject to any capacity limit. &nbsp;<br>b. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">For larger settings/events with &gt;1,000 pax and are mask-on[11]</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">, they would be subject to a capacity limit of 50%. For mask-off events, they would be required to comply with the 1 metre safe distancing requirement and prevailing group size, which will already serve to limit capacity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">See&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-dd875d4325aa749ec8e1246c0a8c59c34.pdf?sfvrsn=c4d29dea_0" title="Annex D">Annex D</a></span>&nbsp;for the list of settings/events covered.<br><br><u>Adjustments to VDS</u></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">30. &nbsp;From&nbsp;<strong>25 February 2022</strong>, unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in 2010 or later) need not be from the same household to be included within a group entering premises or participating in activities with VDS.<br></span><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u>Resuming Sports&nbsp;</u><br><br>31. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">The main driver of COVID-19 transmission has been prolonged close contact with infected persons, such as when eating together. There has been no compelling evidence showing that transient contact while playing sports leads to infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, two years of SMMs have taken its toll on the physical, emotional and mental well-being of our people, especially the young.&nbsp;<br><br>32. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">With the rationalisation of SMMs, from</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;25</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">February 2022</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">, all sports will be allowed to proceed with up to 30 fully vaccinated persons (including players, coaches, umpires etc) , at supervised/operated sports facilities (e.g. ActiveSG facilities and approved private facilities). The prevailing SMMs will apply before and after the sport activity, and during rest breaks. No additional testing requirement will be imposed as long as all participants are fully vaccinated, but participants are strongly encouraged to self-test before arriving for the sports activity, and to stay home if they test positive or develop symptoms.&nbsp;<br><br>33. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">For all the updates on community SMMs above, relevant agencies will provide more details on the requirements specific to their sector.<br><br></span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Updates to Border Measures<br><br></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><u>Streamlining of Country/Region Classification and Border Measures</u><br><br>34. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">To date, our border measures such as pre-departure testing and Stay-Home Notice (SHN) had been aimed at controlling the number of imported cases. As Singapore’s incidence rate is now comparable with most overseas destinations, imported cases are unlikely to affect the trajectory of local cases. Our focus has thus shifted to facilitating inflows from travellers who are less likely to become severely ill and burden our healthcare capacity while they are in Singapore. As vaccination offers good protection against severe disease, we will continue to work towards allowing SHN-free travel for all fully vaccinated travellers. &nbsp;<br><br>35. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">To better position ourselves to do so, we will begin by streamlining the country/region classification. The existing Categories II, III, and IV will be combined into a single&nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">General Travel</u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;category. Fully vaccinated travellers arriving via Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) arrangements can continue to enjoy quarantine-free border measures. For now, all travellers from Category I countries/regions, which have very low infection rates, will continue to enjoy quarantine-free travel arrangements as well[12]</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.

To ride out this wave safely, it remains key that we get our vaccination and booster doses promptly when offered, comply with existing safe management measures, and exercise personal responsibility to self-test before visiting crowded places or interacting with vulnerable groups such as seniors or children. Those who are tested positive should follow the latest health protocols. Patients should refrain from seeking medical attention at the EDs if they have only mild symptoms, so that EDs can focus on taking care of acutely ill patients. Only then can we emerge stronger to resume our transition towards safe re-opening and living with COVID-19.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;<br></strong><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">16 FEBRUARY 2022</strong></p><div style="padding: 0cm 0cm 1pt; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-style: none none solid; text-align: justify;"><p style="padding: 0cm; border: none; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: justify;"><p><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;"><br>[1] Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals.</span></p></div><div id="ftn2" style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">[2] Individuals may check whether they are considered “fully vaccinated” at&nbsp;<span><a href="https://go.gov.sg/vax-status-query">https://go.gov.sg/vax-status-query</a></span>.</span></p></div><div id="ftn3" style="text-align: justify;"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;"><span>[3]&nbsp;</span>Those who test ART positive at non-clinical settings (e.g. unsupervised self-swab or supervised self-swab by test providers in non-clinical settings) but who belong to at-risk groups visit a doctor for medical advice even if they feel well.
