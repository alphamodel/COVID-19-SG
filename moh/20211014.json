It was launched on 1 October 2020 to replace the ElderShield scheme. To ensure that policyholders can benefit from improvements to the claims assessment process, and upgrade more smoothly to CareShield Life, the Government will take over the administration of the ElderShield scheme from private insurers from 1 November 2021.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CareShield Life is mandatory for all Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents born in 1980 or later. From 6 November 2021, the scheme is ready for eligible Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents born in 1979 or earlier to join. Existing ElderShield 400 policyholders who were born in 1970 to 1979 will be automatically enrolled and do not need to take action to join. All others will have to sign up via the CareShield Life website to join.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><strong><br>CareShield Life coverage for cohorts born in 1979 or earlier</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><strong></strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CareShield Life helps address care needs by pooling risks so that each individual has basic financial protection for one\u2019s long-term care costs should one become severely disabled. With one in two Singaporeans aged 65 expected to become severely disabled in their lifetime, the Government accepted the recommendations of the&nbsp;ElderShield Review Committee&nbsp;(ESRC) in 2018 to introduce CareShield Life, an enhanced national long-term care insurance scheme.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Under CareShield Life, individuals who become severely disabled<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;will have better basic financial protection, namely:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><ul type=\"disc\" style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><li><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><u>Increase in payouts</u>: CareShield Life payouts increase annually until age 67 or when a successful claim is made, whichever is earlier.

Auto-enrolment was not extended to this group because it consists of ElderShield 300 policyholders, uninsured individuals, and older individuals who will face higher annual premiums compared to the auto-enrolment group. They should therefore weigh the costs and benefits, and make a conscious decision to opt into CareShield Life. They can check their personalised premiums on the website before submitting their&nbsp;application to join CareShield Life. Existing ElderShield policyholders will continue to be covered under ElderShield if they choose not to upgrade from ElderShield to CareShield Life.</span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We encourage enrolment into CareShield Life, as it will provide better protection than ElderShield, through higher and lifetime payouts.
