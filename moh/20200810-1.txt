1.     As of 10 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 188 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:

a.  IMPORTED CASES: 12 (4 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 1 Work Pass
    holder, 4 Work Permit holders, 3 Dependant’s Pass holders)

    Amongst the 12 imported cases, 4 (Cases 55205, 55284, 55286 and
    55336) are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to
    Singapore on 29 July from India, Bangladesh and the Philippines.
    Another 5 (Cases 55283, 55287, 55353, 55354 and 55355) are Work
    Pass/ Work Permit holders who are currently employed in Singapore.
    They arrived in Singapore from the Philippines on 29 July. The
    remaining 3 (Cases 55226, 55285 and 55328) are Dependant’s Pass
    holders who arrived from India on 27 July and 28 July.

    All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
    arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated
    facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.

b.  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1  (1 Singaporean)

    There is 1 case in the community today (Case 55350) who had been
    identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and had been
    placed on quarantine earlier. He was tested during quarantine to
    determine his status.

    Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained
    stable at an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The
    number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable
    at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will
    continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
    detected through our surveillance programme.

c.  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 175

The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in
the dormitories. There are currently about 23,300 workers who are still
serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when
their isolation ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in
the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.



2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.     Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.

4.     The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the clearing of
dormitories through aggressive testing of workers. The following
dormitories have been cleared, and now house only recovered individuals
and those who have recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As
such, the clusters have now been closed.
