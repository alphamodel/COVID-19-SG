On 11 February, he was tested for COVID-19 even though he is asymptomatic. His test result came back positive on the same day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His serology test result has come back positive.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Case 60192</u></p><p>Case 60192 is a 62 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case 60138<sup>[1]</sup>, and is a homemaker.<br></p><p>She was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February when Case 60138 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. She was tested for COVID-19 on the same day even though she is asymptomatic. Her test came back positive on 11 February, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.<br></p><p>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.<br></p><p>Effective contact tracing is an important enabler to ringfence community transmission. Both Cases 60191 and 60192 do not use the TraceTogether App, and while they both have TraceTogether tokens, they did not carry their tokens with them. Individuals are reminded to turn on their TraceTogether App or carry their TraceTogether token at all times so that we can quickly identify and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and limit further infections.<br></p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br></p><p>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.<br></p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imported cases: 16</strong><br></p><p>Amongst the 16 imported cases,<br></p><p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 (Cases 60163, 60172 and 60179) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India and Indonesia.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 (Case 60178) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from the UAE.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 (Case 60162) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Indonesia.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 (Cases 60171, 60182, 60183, and 60184) are Work Pass holders who arrived from Myanmar, the Philippines and UAE.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India, Indonesia and Myanmar, of whom 6 (Cases 60173, 60174, 60175, 60176, 60177 and 60180) are foreign domestic workers.</p><p>They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.<br></p><p>Case 60162 is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Indonesia on 26 November 2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 10 December. His swab done on 6 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 10 February 2021 in preparation for his return to Indonesia. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load. His serological test result has also come back positive. He reported that before his trip to Singapore, he had interacted with his sibling in Indonesia who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection in October 2020. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.<br></p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/annex-12-feb.pdf?sfvrsn=6bb34240_2\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1613229599329000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3UwNwdtTCWtq2PkH5Cv8_KqEI2Q\" title=\"\" class=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/<wbr>situation-report</a>) for details.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
