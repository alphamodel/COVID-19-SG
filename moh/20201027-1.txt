decreased from 4 cases in the week before, to 3 in the past week. The
number of unlinked cases in the community has increased from 2 cases in

surveillance programme.



CASE DETAILS

A)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1

There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
58148 is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Vietnam under
an Air Travel Pass. She is a caregiver to her sibling who was already
receiving medical treatment in Singapore for an unrelated condition. She
underwent a COVID-19 test upon arrival in Singapore on 10 October and
her result came back negative. She subsequently developed acute
respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms on 23 October and was tested for
COVID-19 under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals
aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with ARI at first presentation to a
doctor. This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to
quickly contain further spread.

B)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.

C)  IMPORTED CASES: 6

Amongst the 6 imported cases, 4 are currently employed in Singapore. Of
these, 2 (Cases 58147 and 58149) are Work Pass holders who arrived from
Japan and France, and 2 (Cases 58150 and 58151) are Work Permit holders
who arrived from Indonesia. Another case (Case 58152) is a Dependant’s
Pass holder who arrived from the UK. The remaining case (Case 58153) is
a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who was allowed entry into Singapore to
visit her child who is a Singapore Permanent Resident. They had all been
placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in Singapore and were tested
while serving SHN.

3.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).

4.  Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

5.  MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the clusters at
CDPL Tuas Dormitory (6 Tuas South Street 15) and Jurong Penjuru
Dormitory 1 (58 Penjuru Place) for the past two incubation periods (i.e.
28 days), the clusters have now been closed.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

6.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex A and Annex B for details.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

7.  4 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,883 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

8.  There are currently 43 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 26 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
