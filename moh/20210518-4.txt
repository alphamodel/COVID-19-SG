EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION ENDORSES EXTENSION OF USE OF PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE IN INDIVIDUALS AGED 12 TO 15 YEARS AND LONGER DOSING INTERVAL FOR MRNA VACCINES


Published Date: 18 May 2021

       The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination endorses the
extension of the interim authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), for use in Singapore in
individuals aged 12 years to 15 years to prevent COVID-19 disease.
2.     In December 2020, the Expert Committee endorsed the interim
authorisation under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) of the
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine by HSA, for use in individuals aged 16
years and above in Singapore. More data from further studies in the age
group of 12 to 15 years old was subsequently submitted by
Pfizer-BioNTech.
3.     The Expert Committee has independently reviewed the vaccine’s
safety and efficacy data submitted for this age group. We have also been
briefed by HSA on its full range of considerations in the extension of
the interim authorisation.In assessing the vaccine, the Expert Committee
took into consideration the safety, efficacy and tolerability of the
vaccine, and study design for this age group.
4.     The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated a high vaccine
efficacy consistent with that observed in the adult population. Its
safety profile is also consistent with the known safety profile in the
adult population and the standards set for other registered vaccines
used in the immunisation against other diseases. Overall, the committee
is satisfied with the safety and efficacy profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech
COVID-19 vaccine for this age group.
DOSING INTERVAL
5.     Additionally, the Expert Committee also considered the emerging
scientific evidence and is of the view that extending the maximum dosing
interval to six to eight weeks, so as to maximise first-dose vaccine
coverage, is a reasonable strategy where there is a compelling need.
EC19V noted that vaccination with the HSA PSAR approved mRNA vaccines is
already considered valid in situations where the second dose is
administered up to six weeks after the first dose. An extension to six
weeks, but not longer than eight weeks, would not materially impact the
eventual overall immune response, as long as the second dose is
eventually administered. Please refer to the Annex for further details
of the Expert Committee’s considerations.
6.     The Expert Committee will continue to monitor and review the use
of COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore as more data becomes available over
time. Singapore remains at risk of a surge in cases and it is therefore
important that we achieve as comprehensive a coverage of COVID-19
vaccination as possible across the entire population. We strongly
encourage all persons who are medically eligible to be vaccinated when
the vaccine is made available to them.
