In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the clusters at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (2 Seletar North Link) and the construction site at 9 Penang Road/ 8 Loyang Crescent for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
