CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today who is currently unlinked.
Case 60432 is a 35 year-old male Bangladesh national who works as a
delivery assistant at Chng Woodworking Pte Ltd, and resides in a
dormitory located at Kranji Way. His job entails loading and unloading
of goods, and he does not interact with clients.
He was detected when his pooled COVID-19 test taken on 21 February as
part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) came back positive. An individual
swab was done on 22 February, and he started to develop a sore throat
and cough on the same day. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection
on 22 February, and was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre
for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on
7 February – were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test
result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current
infection.
Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including his dormitory and
workplace contacts, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and
will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that
we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests
for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected
by them.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 3
Amongst the 3 imported cases,

-   1 (Case 60423) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from the UAE and
    UK.
-   1 (Case 60430) is a Work Permit holder who arrived from the
    Philippines and is a foreign domestic worker.
-   1 (Case 60427) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
    India to visit his family members who are Singapore Permanent
    Residents.

They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
