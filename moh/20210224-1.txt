CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to a previous
case.
Case 60439 is a 35 year-old female Indonesian national who is employed
as a foreign domestic worker by Cases 60102 [1]\ and 60389 [2]. She had
been identified as a close contact of Case 60102 and was placed on
quarantine on 9 February. Her swab taken on 9 February was negative for
COVID-19, and she also tested negative for her serology test on the same
day.
She developed a cough on 20 February during quarantine, but it was not
reported to MOH. On 22 February, she was tested for COVID-19 and her
result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. She was
subsequently conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. Her serological test result has come back positive
but this is likely to be a recent infection. She has also tested
preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further
confirmatory tests.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 6
Amongst the 6 imported cases,
• 2 (Cases 60438 and 60441) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India
and Japan.
• 1 (Case 60444) is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Indonesia and
is a foreign domestic worker.
• 1 (Case 60440) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from India for
studies in Singapore.
• 2 (Cases 60436 and 60437) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders. Case
60436 arrived from Sri Lanka to visit his family member who works in
Singapore. Case 60437 is a sea crew who arrived from Malaysia on a
vessel, and was tested onboard without disembarking.
They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.
4.       Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.       Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.       8 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,761 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.       There are currently 18 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 82 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
SHIPMENTS OF COVID-19 VACCINES
8.       We received the first shipment of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine on
23 February 2021. Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been authorised
by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for use in Singapore. Sinovac has
started submitting initial data, and HSA is currently awaiting Sinovac’s
submission of all the necessary information in order to carry out a
thorough scientific assessment of the manufacturing process, safety and
efficacy of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route.
9.       On 24 February, we also received another shipment of
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. We will continue to monitor our
supplies closely to meet our target of vaccinating all Singaporeans and
long-term residents in Singapore by end of 2021.
