Seven more confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection in Singapore



SEVEN MORE CONFIRMED CASES OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS INFECTION IN SINGAPORE


Published Date: 08 Feb 2020

               As of 8 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
has confirmed seven additional cases of 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) infection in Singapore. Of these, five are linked to
previously announced cases.
2.            Among the new confirmed cases are a taxi driver and a
private hire car driver. MOH will continue to work with the Ministry of
Transport to reach out to all taxi and private hire car drivers on the
steps they should take to protect themselves in the course of their
work. For the general public, the risk of infection from transient
contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to
be low.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
3.            Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This
was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
a)     Cases 8 and 9[1], as well as Cases 31, 33 and 38, are linked to
The Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). This is a
possible cluster involving five cases (Cases 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38).
b)     Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34
and 40) are linked to the cluster associated with Yong Thai Hang (24
Cavan Road).
c)     Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to
the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22
January.
Investigations on these clusters are ongoing.
4.            Contact tracing is underway for the other four locally
transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel
history to mainland China.

identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a
precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their
last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts
who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

HEALTH ADVISORY
30.           Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei
Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.
31.           All travellers should monitor their health closely for two
weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if
they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
    respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

32.           MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases who have
recently been in China, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will
need to be investigated.
