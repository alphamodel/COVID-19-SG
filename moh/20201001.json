Another case (Case 57921) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from India on 28 September. He was allowed entry into Singapore as he was already receiving medical care in Singapore and had returned for further treatment.<br><br>All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 4 (Cases 57922, 57923, 57924 and 57925) are Special Pass holders who are crew members of a ship. They arrived in Singapore from Malaysia on 23 September and had not disembarked from the ship. They subsequently reported symptoms and were swabbed while on the ship, where they had remained until their test results came back positive for COVID-19. They were then conveyed in ambulances to a hospital.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 1 </strong>[1] (1 Permanent Resident)<br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to previous cases. Case 57915 had been identified as a contact of previously confirmed cases, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. He was tested during quarantine to determine his status, even though he is asymptomatic.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 3<br></strong><br>Amongst the 3 cases residing in dormitories, 1 had been identified earlier as a contact of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. He was tested during quarantine to determine his status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 2 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
