    <body><h1>Expert Committee On Covid-19 Vaccination Recommends Booster Vaccination At No Later Than Nine Months</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 05 Jan 2022</p> <p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) recommends that all vaccinated persons aged 18 years and above should receive a booster vaccine dose at about five months after the last dose of their primary vaccine course, or as soon as possible thereafter, in order to maintain good protection against COVID-19. This booster dose should not be delayed beyond nine months after the primary vaccine course.</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2.<span style="font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Local and international data show reduced vaccine protection against COVID-19 infection from around six months after completion of the last vaccine dose in the primary vaccination series or earlier. The level of protection drops even further over time. There is also some reduction in protection against severe disease, particularly in older persons. In addition, international studies have shown that the protection against Omicron variant infection by a primary vaccination series is weaker compared to previous variants, and that boosters increase the protection against infection and severe illnesses caused by Omicron. As such, <strong>booster vaccination is crucial</strong> to ensure continued protection against COVID-19.</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Booster Recommendation for Persons Vaccinated with the mRNA Vaccines</strong></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3.<span style="font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>EC19V therefore recommends that those aged 18 years and above who have completed a primary course comprising two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should receive a booster dose of either mRNA vaccine around five months after the second dose, or as soon as possible thereafter. This booster dose should not be delayed beyond nine months after the primary vaccine course.</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Booster Recommendation for Persons Vaccinated with the Sinovac-CoronaVac and Sinopharm Vaccines</strong></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">4.<span style="font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Persons who had received two or more doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccines as part of a three-dose primary vaccination series are strongly recommended to receive <strong>one dose of an mRNA vaccine as a booster dose. </strong>Such persons who received an mRNA vaccine as their third dose should do so around <strong>five months thereafter</strong>.
