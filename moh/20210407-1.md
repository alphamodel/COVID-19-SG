The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from 3 cases in the week before to 2 cases in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amongst the 173 confirmed cases reported from 1 April to 7 April, 69 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 78 have tested negative, and 26 serology test results are pending.<br><br><strong>Case Details<br><br>a) Cases in the community: 1</strong><br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.&nbsp;<br><br>Case 61639 is a 40 year-old female Myanmar national who is a foreign domestic worker. She arrived from Myanmar on 13 November 2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility. Her test taken on 23 November during SHN was negative for COVID-19. While she was serving SHN, she had been identified as a close contact of Case 58386 during their flight to Singapore, and was placed on quarantine from 24 November to 27 November. On 27 November, she started work at her employer’s residence.<br><br>She developed a headache on 2 April 2021 and shortness of breath on 4 April, and was tested for COVID-19 when she sought medical treatment on 4 April. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day and she was warded at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. Another test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory on 5 April was negative for COVID-19 infection. Her serological test result has come back positive, which is indicative of a past infection. She could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude when she had been infected, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 34</strong><br><br>Amongst the 34 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>-&nbsp; &nbsp;1 (Case 61666) is a Singaporean who returned from the UK.<br>-&nbsp; &nbsp;3 (Cases 61622, 61628 and 61659) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from France, India and Indonesia.<br>-&nbsp; &nbsp;4 (Cases 61623, 61625, 61626 and 61629) are Work Pass holders who arrived from France, India and Indonesia.<br>-&nbsp; &nbsp;23 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, of whom 7 (Cases 61630, 61633, 61638, 61643, 61646, 61647 and 61652) are foreign domestic workers.<br>-&nbsp; &nbsp;3 (Cases 61624, 61631 and 61632) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders.

In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
