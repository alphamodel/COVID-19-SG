unlinked cases in the community has also increased from none in the week

26 March, 31 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 47
have tested negative, and 20 serology test results are pending.
CASE DETAILS
A)            CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1

There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 61184 is a 26 year-old female Myanmar national who is a foreign
domestic worker. She arrived from Myanmar on 23 January and served SHN
at a dedicated facility until 6 February. Her test taken on 5 February
during SHN was negative for COVID-19. Following her SHN, she moved into
a boarding house for foreign domestic workers while waiting for
deployment to an employer, and had not left the boarding house from 6
February to 23 March.
On 23 March, she started work at her employer’s residence. On the same
night, she developed a cough and runny nose. She sought medical
treatment at a General Practitioner clinic on 24 March and was tested
for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection
the next day, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious
Diseases in an ambulance.
Another test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory on 25
March was negative for COVID-19 infection, and her serological test
result has come back positive. She could be shedding minute fragments of
the virus RNA from a past infection, but given that we are not able to
definitively conclude that she had been infected before her arrival in
Singapore, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a
precautionary measure.
 Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including her contacts at the
boarding house and employer’s residence, have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
case could have been infected by them.

B)            CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
 There are no cases residing in dormitories today.

C)            IMPORTED CASES: 11
 Amongst the 11 imported cases,
 •             2 (Cases 61191 and 61204) are Singaporeans who returned

•             1 (Case 61197) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from the

•             6 (Cases 61185, 61187, 61189, 61192, 61193 and 61194) are
Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and the
Philippines.
•             1 (Case 61203) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from
