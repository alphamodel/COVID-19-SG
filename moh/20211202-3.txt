Vaccines



REMINDER TO COMPLETE PRIMARY SERIES OF SINOVAC-CORONAVAC AND SINOPHARM VACCINES


Published Date: 02 Dec 2021

     From 1 December 2021, the Ministry of Health has been progressively
sending out SMS notifications to about 70,000 persons [1] who have taken
two doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccines and aredue for
the remaining dose of their three-dose regime. These persons are
eligible for their third dose from three months after their second dose.
2.  To maintain their fully vaccinated status from 1 January 2022
onwards,they are strongly encouraged to take their third dose BEFORE 31
DECEMBER 2021, AS LONG AS THEIR SECOND DOSE HAD BEEN ADMINISTERED THREE
MONTHS AGO. Beyond this time interval, the individual’s vaccination
status will revert to ‘additional dose needed’ and will be subject to
the current Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS)
[2],as well as the Workforce Vaccination Measures, both of which will
take effect on 1 JANUARY 2022. Individuals should bear in mind the
following:

a) Individuals who have already received two doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac
or Sinopharm vaccines are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED TO RECEIVE A
PSAR-AUTHORISED MRNA VACCINE FOR THEIR THIRD DOSE unless they are
medically ineligible to do so. They can walk into any vaccination centre
offering the mRNA vaccines to receive their third dose. The list of
vaccination centre offering mRNA vaccines can be found
on www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs.

b) Otherwise, they should COMPLETE THEIR PRIMARY SERIES WITH A THIRD
DOSE OF THE SINOVAC-CORONAVAC OR SINOPHARM VACCINES, whichever was
received for the first two doses. The Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine can be
taken at any of the PSAR-authorised private clinics. The list of
PSAR-authorised private clinics can be found
on www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations.

3.   Persons who developed an allergic reaction to the first dose of the
mRNA vaccine and received the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine for their second
dose should also complete a third dose of Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, 28
days after their second dose, to maintain their vaccination status.

4.  The three-dose requirement applies to individuals who have had one
dose of the Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccines, as part of a
two-dose combination of different World Health Organization’s Emergency
Use Listing (WHO-EUL) vaccine brands [3]. Further details on the
requirements for persons who have received a mixed vaccine combination
incorporating Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccines, as well as
recovered persons who took these vaccines, can be found
on https://go.gov.sg/sinovac-mixed-vac-combi.

GRACE PERIOD FOR CHILDREN TURNING 13 IN 2022 TO GET FULLY VACCINATED
5.  As announced on 20 November 2021, the concession for unvaccinated
individuals to perform a pre-event test (PET) in lieu of being fully
vaccinated will be removed with effect on 1 JANUARY 2022. Hence, only
fully vaccinated, recovered, or medically ineligible individuals, or
children aged 12 years and below (i.e. those born in 2010 or after),
will be allowed to enter settings and participate in activities where
VDS are implemented [4].
6.  A grace period will be extended to children born in December 2009
to allow them sufficient time to get fully vaccinated. Children born in
2009 who will turn 13 in 2022 will need to be fully vaccinated to enter
venues and participate in activities with VDS from 1 MARCH 2022 (instead
of 1 January 2022).
WORKFORCE VACCINATION MEASURES

7.  With the implementation of the Workforce Vaccination Measures from
1 January 2022, we will also phase out the “Vaccinate or Regular Test”
regime for all sectors that were onboard the regime as of the same
date.

8.  We continue to strongly recommend persons who can take the
PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines to do so given its higher vaccine
effectiveness against infection and severe disease.
