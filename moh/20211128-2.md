    <body><h1>Deferment of Vaccinated Travel Lanes With Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 28 Nov 2021</p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the global COVID-19 situation and regularly reviews Singaporeâ€™s border measures to manage the risk of importation from travellers and onward local transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified Omicron (B.1.1.529) as a variant of concern. As a precautionary measure to reduce the risks of importation and spread, we will<strong> defer the launch of our Vaccinated Travel Lanes with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</strong>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Deferment of Vaccinated Travel Lanes with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE<br></strong><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We had previously announced that we will be launching Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from 6 December 2021, with applications for the Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) for short-term visitors and long-term pass holders opening on 29 November 2021.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On 26 November 2021, the WHO classified a potentially more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus, known as Omicron (B.1.1.529), as a variant of concern. Scientists around the world are presently working to determine the characteristics of the new Omicron variant, such as whether it is more transmissible than the Delta variant, and if it is more likely to lead to severe illnesses. Singapore has not detected any cases of this variant to date.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a precautionary move to reduce the risks of importation and spread of the Omicron variant to Singapore, we will be <strong>deferring the commencement of the VTLs for Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE until further notice</strong>. This is in view of their proximity as transport nodes to the affected countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe<sup>1</sup>. We will provide more details on the commencement of these VTLs at a later date.<br><br><strong>Regular Review of Border Measures<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are reviewing our border measures, and will announce more details soon.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID resilient nation. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the <a href="http://safetravel.ica.gov.sg" title="" class="" target="">SafeTravel website</a>. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures for the associated country or region before entering Singapore; and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>28 NOVEMBER 2021</strong><br><div><br><sup>1</sup> Please refer to the <a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-on-border-measures-for-travellers-from-botswana-eswatini-lesotho-mozambique-namibia-south-africa-and-zimbabwe" title="" class="" target="">Press Release</a>&nbsp;on 26 November 2021.<br></div></body>
