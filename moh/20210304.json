However Case 60626 received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 26 February, and these symptoms might also have been due to the vaccination. As she had been identified as a close contact of Case 60588, she was placed on quarantine on 2 March, and was tested for COVID-19 as part of our protocol to test individuals during quarantine. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Her serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.<br><br>As the vaccine does not contain live virus, Case 60626 could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.<br><br>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including her family members, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.<br><br><br><strong>c)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imported cases: 18</strong><br><br>&nbsp;Amongst the 18 imported cases,<br><br>\u2022&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3 (Cases 60625, 60628 and 60635) are Singaporeans and 1 (Case 60631) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from Ghana, India, Indonesia and the US.<br>\u2022&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 (Case 60624) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from Malaysia.<br>\u2022&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;11 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, of whom 5 (Cases 60620, 60622, 60636, 60637 and 60641) are foreign domestic workers.<br>\u2022&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 (Case 60644) is a Student's Pass holder who arrived from the US for studies in Singapore.<br>\u2022&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 (Case 60633) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Indonesia to visit her Singaporean relative.<br>&nbsp;<br>They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/annex4-mar.pdf?sfvrsn=d2edac4_2\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"http://moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
