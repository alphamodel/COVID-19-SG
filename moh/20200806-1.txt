301 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 06 Aug 2020

             As of 6 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 301 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in
foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there
are 4 cases in the community, of whom 3 are Singaporeans/ Permanent
Residents and 1 is a Work Pass holder.

2.  In addition, there are 4 imported cases, who had all been
placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.

3.  We continue to aggressively test the final batch of
dormitory residents, and remain on track to clear all the dormitories by
7 August, except for a few standalone blocks in the dormitories that
serve as quarantine facilities. Depending on the prevalence of COVID-19
at the remaining dormitories whose residents are being tested, the daily
case counts may vary. We expect the number to remain volatile in the
coming days, before tapering down thereafter as the Inter-agency
Taskforce completes the dormitory clearance.

4  We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
