As a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all guests, the hotel has stopped accepting new guests since 19 December, and all existing guests checked out by 9pm on 20 December. All individuals serving SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore have been transported via dedicated vehicles to an alternative SHN dedicated facility on 20 December.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH has completed our special testing operations to test all individuals serving SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore, as well as staff of the hotel. In total, 394 persons serving SHN at the hotel have been swabbed. Of these, 391 were tested negative while 3 (Cases 58656, 58657 and 58658) were tested positive on 20 December and were immediately conveyed to the hospital via ambulance. These 3 cases have also tested serology positive. Given their serology results and recent travel history, it is likely that these are imported cases who were infected while they were overseas. These cases were announced by MOH on 20 December, and included in our daily case count. </p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In total, MOH has tested 571 staff of Mandarin Orchard Singapore, and all the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test results have come back negative for COVID-19 infection. This means there is no ongoing infection among staff of the hotel. The serological tests of 8 more staff have come back positive, indicating likely past infections, in addition to the 3 announced yesterday. Epidemiological investigations of these 11 cases are in progress. In the meantime, we will test their identified close contacts as a precautionary measure, and also conduct serological tests to determine if these individuals could have been infected by them.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore reports COVID-19 cases in accordance with international practice. Every case who tested positive through a PCR test and is assessed to be an acute infection is reported and included in our case count. We follow the World Health Organization\u2019s criterion that only positive results from confirmatory tests (i.e. PCR tests) are included in the case count. This ensures consistency in reporting cases across countries. The 11 cases whose serological tests have come back positive, but whose PCR test results are negative for COVID-19 infection, are therefore not included in our daily case count.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong></p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,287 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities. </p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are currently 46 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 70 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>21 DECEMBER 2020</strong></p><p><sup>[1]</sup> Cases 58204, 58235, 58233, 58236, 58237, 58234, 58244, 58245, 58253, 58252, 58268, 58281 and 58284.

Regular checks on these hotels are conducted to ensure that safe management measures are complied with, and security measures are in place.

The changes will be implemented in March 2021.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Government has announced earlier that we will provide premium subsidies and support of up to $2.2 billion over the next three years to help Singapore Residents with their MediShield Life premiums. Following the public consultation held on the MediShield Life Council\u2019s recommendations, we will defer premium payment until end December 2021 for those who do not have sufficient MediSave balances to pay their premiums in the coming year. We will also enhance the annual MediSave top-ups for Pioneer Generation (PG) seniors.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;These measures will keep the net premium increases for all Singapore Citizens to no more than about 10% in the first year.<br><br><strong>MediShield Life Council\u2019s Recommendations</strong><br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Government has reviewed the MediShield Life Council\u2019s recommendations, and is satisfied that the recommended benefit changes will ensure that MediShield Life continues to provide adequate and meaningful protection to Singaporeans. The actuarially determined premium adjustments are necessary to support the rising number of claims and payouts as well as the benefit changes, and will ensure that MediShield Life remains sustainable in the coming years. We also note that the Council will appoint a committee to review MediShield Life coverage for cancer therapies, in response to feedback on the need to contain rising healthcare costs.<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The key recommended benefits include updating and refining the claim limits to provide better coverage, introducing treatment-specific claim limits for costlier types of community hospital care and outpatient radiotherapy, raising the policy year claim limit from $100,000 to $150,000, and allowing higher daily claim limits for the first two days of acute hospital stays, amongst others.<br>&nbsp;<br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The higher daily claim limits for the first two days of acute hospital stays will provide better coverage for short stays for patients who can be discharged earlier. In support of this recommendation, the Government will also adjust the MediSave withdrawal limits for acute hospital stays in tandem, as shown in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Table A</span>.

This comprises $1.8 billion for existing premium subsidies and support measures for lower and middle-income households, PG and Merdeka Generation (MG) seniors, and the financially needy (see details in <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-a387065748bee44ffa47134ec48f716ad.pdf?sfvrsn=4cdd3749_0\" title=\"Annex A\">Annex A</a>), and $360 million for the new COVID-19 Subsidy.&nbsp;<br><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">COVID-19 Subsidy.</span> The Government earlier announced a one-off COVID-19 subsidy for all Singapore Citizens for two years to further cushion the impact of the premium adjustments during this exceptional period. This will subsidise 70% of the net increase in premiums (after taking into account existing premium subsidies) in the first year, followed by 30% in the second year. Taken together with the existing premium support measures, the net premium increases for all Singapore Citizens will be kept to no more than about 10% in the first year.&nbsp;<br><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Deferment of Premium Payment for those with Insufficient MediSave balances.</span> MediShield Life premiums can be fully paid using MediSave. The vast majority of Singaporeans have sufficient MediSave for their premiums. Family members can also utilise their MediSave to help pay the premiums for their loved ones. Nonetheless, to further allay concerns about premium payment during this exceptional period due to the economic impact of COVID-19, the Government will defer the payment of outstanding premiums until end December 2021 for Singapore Residents who have insufficient MediSave balances and are unable to pay their premiums. In addition, the financially needy can apply for Additional Premium Support for assistance with their premiums.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Enhancements to PG MediSave Top-Ups</strong><br><br>10.&nbsp; &nbsp;Currently, PG seniors receive $200 to $800 in annual MediSave top-ups, which can be used to pay for their MediShield Life premiums. As part of our commitment to keep premiums affordable for PG seniors, the Government will provide higher lifetime annual MediSave top-ups of $250 to $900 to all PG seniors from 2021. For older PG seniors (aged 81 years old and above in 2020) who have serious pre-existing conditions and need to pay higher premiums, we will also provide a one-off MediSave top-up of $50 to $200 per year for five years, from 2021 to 2025. Please refer to <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-bb3513b1d4df3423e921f436ae5e0ae09.pdf?sfvrsn=7242de16_0\" title=\"Annex B\">Annex B</a>&nbsp;for details on the enhanced annual PG MediSave top-up amounts.<br><br>11.&nbsp; &nbsp; After these enhancements, all PG seniors who are 86 years old and above in 2020 will continue to have their MediShield Life premiums fully covered by the special PG premium subsidies and MediSave top-ups, while younger PGs will have about two-thirds of their MediShield Life premiums covered.&nbsp;<br><br>12.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For example, the revised MediShield Life premium for an 89-year-old PG senior is $2,025. After taking into account the special PG premium subsidy, the net premium payable is $831, which can be fully covered by the senior\u2019s enhanced PG MediSave top-up of $900. The revised premium for a 74-year-old PG senior\u2019s premium is $1,320 and the net premium payable after the special PG premium subsidy is $674. With the enhanced MediSave top-up of $250, the senior pays the remaining $424 or about one-third of his original premium using his own MediSave or cash. The COVID-19 subsidy will further reduce the net premium payable in 2021 and 2022.

To ensure that the scheme can continue to be relevant and sustainable, the Government has accepted the MediShield Life Council\u2019s recommendations to enhance the scheme and adjust the premiums. At the same time, we understand that Singaporeans will need more support during this period. We will provide up to $2.2 billion in premium subsidies and support, including an additional COVID-19 subsidy for all Singapore Citizens. We will ensure that MediShield Life continues to provide coverage for all Singaporeans, for life, and ensure that the premiums remain affordable.\u201d<br><br>15.&nbsp; The Government thanks the Council for the time and effort committed to the comprehensive review.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;<br>21 DECEMBER 2020</strong></span></span></p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "government-accepts-medishield-life-council-s-recommendations-and-commits-2.2-billion-for-premium-subsidies-and-support", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
