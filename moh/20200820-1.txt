Published Date: 20 Aug 2020

       As of 20 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 68 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 2 (2 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents)
Both the imported cases today are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who
returned to Singapore from India on 6 August and 8 August. They had been
placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and
had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 per day in the past 2
weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the
cases detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 66
The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in
the dormitories. There are currently about 14,500 workers who are still
serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when
their quarantine ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in
the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.

Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex

3.        Of the new cases, 99% are imported or linked to known cases/
