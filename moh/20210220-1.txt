4.    Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.        Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
6.        MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the Case 59429
cluster for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster
has now been closed.

hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,719 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
