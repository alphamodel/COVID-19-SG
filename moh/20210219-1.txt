from 8 cases in the week before to 1 case in the past week. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from 5 cases in
the week before to 1 case in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

February, 44 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 10
have tested negative, and 15 serology test results are pending.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 14
Amongst the 14 imported cases,
• 1 (Case 60324) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from
Indonesia.
• 3 (Cases 60318, 60323 and 60337) are Dependant’s Pass holders who
arrived from India and Indonesia.
• 4 (Cases 60316, 60319, 60321 and 60325) are Work Pass holders who
arrived from India, Nepal and the UAE.
• 3 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Indonesia and Malaysia, of
whom 1 (Case 60322) is a foreign domestic worker.
• 3 (Cases 60328, 60329 and 60330) are Special Pass holders who are sea
crew, and arrived from Malaysia and the UAE. They had not disembarked
from their vessels and were tested onboard.
They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.
Of these, 13 are not required to undergo mandatory on-arrival serology
tests upon arrival¹. The remaining case tested positive for her
on-arrival serology test, but as we are unable to definitively conclude
that she was no longer infectious when she arrived in Singapore, we will
take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.
Case 60316 is a Work Pass holder who arrived from India on 30 December
2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 3 January 2021. As he
had been identified as a close contact of Case 58944, he was
subsequently placed on quarantine from 3 January to 13 January. His
swabs done on 4 January and 10 January during quarantine were negative
for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a
COVID-19 pre-departure test on 17 February in preparation for his return
to India. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the
next day, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a
low viral load. Another sample taken on 18 February tested negative for
COVID-19. His serological test result has also come back positive. Given
that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case
as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus
RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.
4.      Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.      Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.      18 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,697 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.      There are currently 20 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 100 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
[1] From 5 February, newly arrived Work Permit and S Pass holders in the
Construction, Marine and Process sectors, foreign domestic workers and
confinement nannies, who have recent travel history to higher-risk
countries/ regions, are required to undergo mandatory on-arrival
serology tests, in addition to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.
