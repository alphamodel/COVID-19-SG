A)  IMPORTED CASES: 9 (1 Permanent Resident, 3 Work Pass
holders, 1 Work Permit holder, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders, 2 Student’s
Pass holders)

Amongst the 9 imported cases, 1 (Case 57723) is a Singapore Permanent
Resident who returned to Singapore from India on 9 September. 4 (Cases
57721, 57727, 57741 and 57742) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders
currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India on 9 September
and Iran on 15 September. Another 2 cases (Cases 57722 and 57728) are
Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from India on 9 September and Iran
on 15 September. The remaining 2 (Cases 57720 and 57724) are Student’s
Pass holders who arrived from India on 9 September.

All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.



B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0

There are no cases in the community today.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked
cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of fewer
than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.



C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 22

Amongst the 22 cases residing in dormitories, 16 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.

The remaining 6 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past
infections.[1] The serological test results for 2 cases have come back
positive so far, which indicate likely past infection

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.  Of the new cases, 90% are imported or linked to known
cases/ clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.

4.  MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Kian Teck
Hostel (30 Kian Teck Avenue) for the past two incubation periods (i.e.
28 days), the cluster has now been closed.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

5.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

6.  60 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,241 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

7.  There are currently 36 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 302 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.

MINISTRY OF HEALTH
21 SEPTEMBER 2020

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
