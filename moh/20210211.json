Based on our investigations so far, the cases are in the community, and there are no new cases in the dormitories. <br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, there are 9 imported cases, who had already been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore. In total, there are 12 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore today. <br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight. <br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With increased interactions over the Chinese New Year period, there will be higher transmission risks in the community. It is important that everyone remain vigilant and adhere to the safe management measures. The number of visitors per household per day is limited to 8 distinct persons. We encourage everyone to connect digitally with their family and friends instead of going on physical visits. For those who plan to do house visits, they should limit their visits to family members and to not more than 2 other households a day. Face masks must be worn during <em>lohei</em>, and there should not be any verbalisation of the usual auspicious phrases. If we all play our part, we can continue to keep the number of cases in our community low.</p> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>11 FEBRUARY 2021</strong></p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "3-new-cases-of-locally-transmitted-covid-19-infection-11feb", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
