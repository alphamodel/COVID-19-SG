A) IMPORTED CASES: 9 (1 Singaporean, 5 Permanent Residents, 1 Work Pass
holder, 1 Work Permit holder, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder)
Amongst the 9 imported cases, 1 (Case 57878) is a Singaporean and 5
(Cases 57869, 57870, 57871, 57879 and 57881) are Singapore Permanent
Residents who returned to Singapore from Indonesia on 18 September and
India between 16 September and 18 September. Another 2 (Cases 57866 and
57880) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently employed in
Singapore who arrived from Indonesia on 17 September and India on 16
September. The remaining case (Case 57868) is a Dependant’s Pass holder
who arrived from India on 17 September.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Work Permit holder)
There is 1 case in the community today who was detected as a result of
our proactive case finding. Case 57867 had been identified as a
household contact of Cases 57847 and 57861. When contacted by MOH on 27
September after Case 57847 was confirmed with COVID-19 infection, Case
57867 reported having symptoms earlier and was immediately conveyed to a
hospital for a swab. He was tested positive subsequently.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an
average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 17
Amongst the 17 cases residing in dormitories, 8 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 9 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
2. Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex A for
the summary of the confirmed cases.
3. Of the new cases, 85% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
4. MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to SLR Revolution
at Excelsior Shopping Centre (5 Coleman Street) for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6. 73 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,466 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7. There are currently 32 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of
these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care
unit. 217 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are
those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
