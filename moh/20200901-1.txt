A) IMPORTED CASES: 7 (3 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 2 Work Pass
holders, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder, 1 Short-Term Visit Pass holder)
Amongst the 7 imported cases, 3 (Cases 56916, 56915 and 56917) are
Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India
on 16 August, and the US on 18 August. 2 cases (Cases 56913 and 56918)
are  Work Pass holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from
Bangladesh and Brazil on 16 August. Another case (Case 56911) is a
Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from Bangladesh on 16 August. The
remaining case (Case 56919) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder whose
parents are Singapore Permanent Residents. All of them had been placed
on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been
tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Work Pass holder)
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
56899 was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of
workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living
outside the dormitories. She was asymptomatic, and was detected through
our proactive testing. Epidemiological investigations of the case are in
progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case
have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the
start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for her
household contacts to determine if she could have been infected by
them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 32
Amongst the 32 cases residing in dormitories, 22 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 10 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with acute respiratory infection (ARI)
symptoms. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic
ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections. [1] The serological test results for 9 cases have come
back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.       Of the new cases, 98% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.        Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.        91 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 55,749 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.      There are currently 86 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 990 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.

==
[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
