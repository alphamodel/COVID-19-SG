She arrived from Myanmar on 23 January and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 6 February. Her test taken on 5 February during SHN was negative for COVID-19. Following her SHN, she moved into a boarding house for foreign domestic workers while waiting for deployment to an employer, and had not left the boarding house from 6 February to 23 March.<br><br>On 23 March, she started work at her employer’s residence. On the same night, she developed a cough and runny nose. She sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner clinic on 24 March and was tested for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in an ambulance.<br><br>Another test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory on 25 March was negative for COVID-19 infection, and her serological test result has come back positive. She could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude that she had been infected before her arrival in Singapore, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.<br><br>&nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including her contacts at the boarding house and employer’s residence, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br><br>&nbsp;There are no cases residing in dormitories today.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>c)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imported cases: 11</strong><br><br>&nbsp;Amongst the 11 imported cases,<br><br>&nbsp;•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 (Cases 61191 and 61204) are Singaporeans who returned from Qatar and the UAE.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 (Case 61197) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from the Philippines.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6 (Cases 61185, 61187, 61189, 61192, 61193 and 61194) are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and the Philippines.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 (Case 61203) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from India for studies in Singapore.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1 (Case 61186) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Romania as part of an eSport event crew.<br><br>They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/a.pdf?sfvrsn=f2466446_4" title="Annexes">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH’s daily Situation Report (<a href="http://moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>&nbsp;5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 17 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
