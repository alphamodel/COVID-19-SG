As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at PPT Lodge 1A (8 Seletar North Link) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
