Published Date: 29 Jul 2020

1.     As of 29 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 334 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:

a.  IMPORTED CASES: 4 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Pass holder, 2 Student’s
    Pass holders)



    Amongst the 4 imported cases, 1 (Case 51546) is a Singaporean who
    returned to Singapore from India on 17 July. Another case
    (Case 51536) is a Work Pass holder who is currently employed in
    Singapore, and had arrived from the Philippines on 15 July. The
    remaining 2 cases (Cases 51340 and 51560) are Student’s Pass holders
    who arrived from India on 14 July, and from Indonesia on 17 July.
    All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
    arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated
    facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.

b.  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3 (2 Singaporeans, 1 Work Pass holder)



    All 3 cases in the community today are linked to previous cases or
    clusters. Cases 51369, 51609 and 51610 had been identified as
    contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been placed on
    quarantine earlier. They were tested during quarantine to determine
    their status, even though they are asymptomatic.

    Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased,
    from an average of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average
    of 4 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the
    community has also decreased, from an average of 5 cases per day in
    the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. We
    will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
    detected through our surveillance programme.

c.  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 327

We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.

2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.     Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.

4.     The Inter-Agency Task Force has been systematically and
progressively clearing dormitories through aggressive testing of migrant
workers residing in dormitories. The following dormitories have been
cleared, and now house only recovered individuals and those who have
