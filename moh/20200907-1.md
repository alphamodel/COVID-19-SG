    <body><h1>75 More Cases Discharged, 22 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 07 Sep 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 7 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 22 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>Summary of new cases<br></strong><br>All new cases today are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance.&nbsp;</p><div style="text-align: justify;"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center"><strong>Already in quarantine/ isolation before detection</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center"><strong>Detected from surveillance</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center"><strong>Total</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p><strong>Imported cases</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">3</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">0</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">3</p></td></tr><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p><strong>Cases in the community</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">0</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">1</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">1</p></td></tr><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p><strong>Cases residing in dormitories</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">9</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">9</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">18</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 3 </strong>(1 Permanent Resident, 1 Work Permit holder, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder)<br><br><span style="font-size: 13px;">Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 57168) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned to Singapore from India on 26 August. Another case (Case 57154) is a Work Permit holder currently employed in Singapore who arrived from the Philippines on 26 August. The remaining case (Case 57159) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from India on 26 August. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.&nbsp;<br></span><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 1</strong> (1 Work Pass holder)<br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 57170 was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 18<br></strong><br>Amongst the 18 cases residing in dormitories, 9 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 9 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections [1]. The serological test results for 6 cases have come back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

In all, 56,408 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are currently 51 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 558 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>7 SEPTEMBER 2020<br><br></strong>[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective to others.<br></div></body>
