The NMA started in 1976 and is awarded to nurses who have displayed noteworthy and exceptional performance, participated in professional development, and contributed to raising the nursing profession. Nurses are nominated for the award by their healthcare institutions and selected by a panel set up by the Ministry of Health (MOH).</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2.<span style="font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The award recipients come from various care settings, spanning the community care sector, private hospitals and public healthcare institutions.

The two new competency frameworks will provide clarity on the job roles, responsibilities and the associated professional competencies for nurses working in palliative and geriatric care settings to meet the growing healthcare needs of the ageing population in Singapore. The competency frameworks will serve as a guide for nurses and employers to identify skills gaps and pursue development opportunities.</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>Integrated Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) Internship Programme</u></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><u>&nbsp;</u></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">5.<span style="font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MOH will continue to strengthen training for Advanced Practice Nurses (APNs),<span> </span>who have acquired the expert knowledge base, complex decision-making skills and clinical competencies for extended practice. APNs are trained in the diagnosis and management of common medical conditions, including chronic illnesses. The APN internship programme, which forms part of the training for APNs, is regularly reviewed to ensure its training methods and curriculum delivery encourage optimal learning. To date, there are a total of 321 APNs in Singapore.</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">6.<span style="font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Last year, we introduced a new Integrated APN Internship Programme (IAI)<sup>1</sup>, which facilitates an early integration of Master of Nursing graduates to their respective areas of clinical practice and emphasises work-place based assessments that would form the requirement towards APN certification.
