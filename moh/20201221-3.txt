GOVERNMENT ACCEPTS MEDISHIELD LIFE COUNCIL’S RECOMMENDATIONS AND COMMITS S$2.2 BILLION FOR PREMIUM SUBSIDIES AND SUPPORT


Published Date: 21 Dec 2020

HIGHER MEDISAVE TOP-UPS FOR PIONEER GENERATION AND PREMIUM PAYMENT
DEFERRED FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY
      The Government has accepted all the recommendations of the
MediShield Life Council on the MediShield Life 2020 review which will
ensure that MediShield Life continues to provide adequate and meaningful
protection to Singaporeans. The changes will be implemented in March
2021.
2.   The Government has announced earlier that we will provide premium
subsidies and support of up to $2.2 billion over the next three years to
help Singapore Residents with their MediShield Life premiums. Following
the public consultation held on the MediShield Life Council’s
recommendations, we will defer premium payment until end December 2021
for those who do not have sufficient MediSave balances to pay their
premiums in the coming year. We will also enhance the annual MediSave
top-ups for Pioneer Generation (PG) seniors.
3.   These measures will keep the net premium increases for all
Singapore Citizens to no more than about 10% in the first year.
MEDISHIELD LIFE COUNCIL’S RECOMMENDATIONS
4.   The Government has reviewed the MediShield Life Council’s
recommendations, and is satisfied that the recommended benefit changes
will ensure that MediShield Life continues to provide adequate and
meaningful protection to Singaporeans. The actuarially determined
premium adjustments are necessary to support the rising number of claims
and payouts as well as the benefit changes, and will ensure that
MediShield Life remains sustainable in the coming years. We also note
that the Council will appoint a committee to review MediShield Life
coverage for cancer therapies, in response to feedback on the need to
contain rising healthcare costs.
5.     The key recommended benefits include updating and refining the
claim limits to provide better coverage, introducing treatment-specific
claim limits for costlier types of community hospital care and
outpatient radiotherapy, raising the policy year claim limit from
$100,000 to $150,000, and allowing higher daily claim limits for the
first two days of acute hospital stays, amongst others.

6.      The higher daily claim limits for the first two days of acute
hospital stays will provide better coverage for short stays for patients
who can be discharged earlier. In support of this recommendation, the
Government will also adjust the MediSave withdrawal limits for acute
hospital stays in tandem, as shown in Table A. Taken together, the new
MediShield Life and MediSave limits will result in lower out-of-pocket
costs for patients.

^ This is the limit for normal ward stays. ICU ward stays are subject to
a MediShield Life claim limit of $2,400 per day for the first two days,
and $2,200 per day from the third day onwards. The same MediSave
withdrawal limit applies for both normal ward and ICU ward stays.

GOVERNMENT’S PREMIUM SUPPORT MEASURES
7.   The Government will provide up to $2.2 billion for premium
subsidies and support over the next three years to help Singapore
Residents with their premiums. This comprises $1.8 billion for existing
premium subsidies and support measures for lower and middle-income
households, PG and Merdeka Generation (MG) seniors, and the financially
needy (see details in Annex A), and $360 million for the new COVID-19
Subsidy.
8.     COVID-19 Subsidy. The Government earlier announced a one-off
COVID-19 subsidy for all Singapore Citizens for two years to further
cushion the impact of the premium adjustments during this exceptional
period. This will subsidise 70% of the net increase in premiums (after
taking into account existing premium subsidies) in the first year,
followed by 30% in the second year. Taken together with the existing
premium support measures, the net premium increases for all Singapore
Citizens will be kept to no more than about 10% in the first year.
9.   Deferment of Premium Payment for those with Insufficient MediSave
balances. MediShield Life premiums can be fully paid using MediSave. The
vast majority of Singaporeans have sufficient MediSave for their
premiums. Family members can also utilise their MediSave to help pay the
premiums for their loved ones. Nonetheless, to further allay concerns
about premium payment during this exceptional period due to the economic
impact of COVID-19, the Government will defer the payment of outstanding
premiums until end December 2021 for Singapore Residents who have
insufficient MediSave balances and are unable to pay their premiums. In
addition, the financially needy can apply for Additional Premium Support
for assistance with their premiums.
ENHANCEMENTS TO PG MEDISAVE TOP-UPS
10.   Currently, PG seniors receive $200 to $800 in annual MediSave
top-ups, which can be used to pay for their MediShield Life premiums. As
part of our commitment to keep premiums affordable for PG seniors, the
Government will provide higher lifetime annual MediSave top-ups of $250
to $900 to all PG seniors from 2021. For older PG seniors (aged 81 years
old and above in 2020) who have serious pre-existing conditions and need
to pay higher premiums, we will also provide a one-off MediSave top-up
of $50 to $200 per year for five years, from 2021 to 2025. Please refer
to Annex B for details on the enhanced annual PG MediSave top-up
amounts.
11.    After these enhancements, all PG seniors who are 86 years old and
above in 2020 will continue to have their MediShield Life premiums fully
covered by the special PG premium subsidies and MediSave top-ups, while
younger PGs will have about two-thirds of their MediShield Life premiums
covered.
12.     For example, the revised MediShield Life premium for an
89-year-old PG senior is $2,025. After taking into account the special
PG premium subsidy, the net premium payable is $831, which can be fully
covered by the senior’s enhanced PG MediSave top-up of $900. The revised
premium for a 74-year-old PG senior’s premium is $1,320 and the net
premium payable after the special PG premium subsidy is $674. With the
enhanced MediSave top-up of $250, the senior pays the remaining $424 or
about one-third of his original premium using his own MediSave or cash.
The COVID-19 subsidy will further reduce the net premium payable in 2021
and 2022. Please refer to Annex C for the detailed illustrations after
the COVID-19 subsidy is phased out.
13.    Please refer to Annex D for additional details on net premiums
after taking into account Government support.
14.     Mr Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Health, said, “MediShield Life was
created to ensure that Singaporeans would be protected against large
hospital bills for life. To ensure that the scheme can continue to be
relevant and sustainable, the Government has accepted the MediShield
Life Council’s recommendations to enhance the scheme and adjust the
premiums. At the same time, we understand that Singaporeans will need
more support during this period. We will provide up to $2.2 billion in
premium subsidies and support, including an additional COVID-19 subsidy
for all Singapore Citizens. We will ensure that MediShield Life
continues to provide coverage for all Singaporeans, for life, and ensure
that the premiums remain affordable.”
15.  The Government thanks the Council for the time and effort committed
to the comprehensive review.
