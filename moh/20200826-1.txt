A) IMPORTED CASES: 10 (5 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 2 Work Pass
holders, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders, 1 Long-Term Visit pass holder)
Amongst the 10 imported cases, 5 (Cases 56554, 56555, 56569, 56570 and
56571) are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore
from India on 14 August. Another 2 (Cases 56558 and 56559) are Work Pass
holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India and the
Philippines on 14 August. The remaining 3 (Cases 56523, 56524 and 56560)
are Dependant’s Pass and Long-Term Pass holders who arrived from India
and the US on 12 August and 14 August.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated
facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3 (1 Singaporean, 2 Work Permit holders)
Of the 3 cases in the community, 2 had already been placed on quarantine
earlier. 2 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected through our
proactive testing.
2 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases. Both (Cases
56540 and 56542) had been identified as contacts of a previously
confirmed case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. They were
tested during quarantine to determine their status.
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
56522 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to
identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further
spread.
Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for his household contacts to
determine if he could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 47
Amongst the 47 cases residing in dormitories, 29 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 18 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with ARI symptoms. This allows us to
pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to
ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively
containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections [1]. The serological test results for 7 cases have come
back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.       Of the new cases, 97% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.    Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.    155 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 54,971 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.     There are currently 65 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 1,432 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still
test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due
to COVID-19 infection.

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
