Published Date: 09 Aug 2020

       As of 9 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 175 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 3 (1 Singaporean, 2 Work Pass holders)
Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 55143) is a Singaporean who
returned to Singapore from India on 25 July. The remaining 2 (Cases
55138 and 55142) are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in
Singapore. They arrived in Singapore from India on 26 July. All of them
had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in
Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had
been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1  (1 Singaporean)
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
55169 was tested after she sought medical treatment for prolonged acute
respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. Epidemiological investigations of
the case are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close
contacts have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested
at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 171
The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in
the dormitories on 7 August, and some of the test results are still
being processed. There are currently about 23,500 workers who are still
serving out their isolation period at quarantine facilities. These
workers will be tested when their isolation ends, and we expect the case
counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down
thereafter.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     Of the new cases, 98% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.     In the past week (2 August to 8 August), MOH has uncovered links
for 1 previously unlinked case in the community.
5.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.

hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 48,915 have fully
