ISSUANCE OF GENERAL CORRECTION DIRECTIONS UNDER THE PROTECTION FROM ONLINE FALSEHOODS AND MANIPULATION ACT ON FALSEHOODS ON “SINGAPORE” STRAIN


Published Date: 20 May 2021

          The Ministry of Health (MOH) is aware of a false statement
circulating online by multiple media outlets and social media platforms,
which implies that a new, previously unknown variant of COVID-19
originated in Singapore and/or risks spreading to India from Singapore.

2.  The Minister for Health has instructed the POFMA Office to
issue General Correction Directions[1] to Facebook, Twitter and SPH
Magazines Pte Ltd (HardwareZone forum). Facebook, Twitter and SPH
Magazines are required to carry the Correction Notice to all end-users
in Singapore who use Facebook, Twitter and HardwareZone.com.

CORRECTIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS REGARDING FALSEHOODS ON “SINGAPORE”
STRAIN

3.  There is no new “Singapore” variant of COVID 19. Neither is
there evidence of any COVID-19 variant that is ‘extremely dangerous for
kids’. The strain that is prevalent in many of the COVID-19 cases
detected in Singapore in recent weeks is the B.1.617.2 variant, which
originated from India. The existence and spread of the B.1.617.2 variant
within India predates the detection of the variant in Singapore, and
this has been publicly known and reported by various media sources from
as early as 5 May 2021.

4.  For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article
“Corrections and Clarifications Regarding Falsehoods on “Singapore”
Strain” at https://www.gov.sg/article/factually200521.

5.  We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or
spread unfounded rumors. Please visit www.moh.gov.sg for latest
information on COVID-19.
