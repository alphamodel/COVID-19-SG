Case 58425 is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who was allowed entry into Singapore to visit his family members who are Singaporeans. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he went for a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 28 November before a scheduled trip to the US.<br><br>He was conveyed to the hospital when his test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 29 November. His serological test result is also positive, which indicates likely past infection.<br><br>He had arrived in Singapore from Nepal on 1 November, and was placed on 14-day SHN at a dedicated facility upon arrival in Singapore from 1 November to 15 November. He was tested negative for COVID-19 infection on 11 November while serving SHN. He subsequently stayed at a friend’s flat at Bishan Street 22, and visited his family staying at Yishun Avenue 6.<br><br>Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0&nbsp;</strong><br><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 4<br><br></strong>Amongst the 4 imported cases, 1 (Case 58426) is a Singaporean who returned to Singapore from Japan.

These enable us to contain cryptic cases in the community early, and prevent further transmission. We conducted community testing operations on 27 November and 28 November for individuals working at Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre. In all, 1,068 individuals were tested, and all the results have come back negative.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases<br><br></strong>5.<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>10 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,134 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 29 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 26 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>30 NOVEMBER 2020</strong></span></p></body>
