    <body><h1>Updates On Border Measures for Travellers From Higher Risk Countries/ Regions </h1>
    <p>Published Date: 23 Jun 2021</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation, and will be reducing the duration of the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) based on updated evidence gathered over the past month. From <strong>23 June 2021, 2359 hours</strong>, all new travellers arriving from higher risk countries/regions will be subject to a 14-day SHN, instead of 21 days at dedicated SHN facilities.</p> <p><strong>Reviewing Border Measures to Manage Risks</strong></p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;In late-April 2021, little was known about the emerging variant of concern, including its incubation period. As a precaution, we had required travellers with recent travel history to higher risk countries/regions [1]&nbsp;to serve a 21-day SHN. We have since reviewed the international evidence and local case data.</p><p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;While there is increased transmissibility with the new variants of concern, we have found no evidence – from both overseas and local data – that these variants come with longer incubation periods. Since we introduced the 21-day SHN for all travellers with recent travel history to higher risk countries/regions from 8 May 2021, we have had 270 imported cases among such travellers (as of 22 June 2021). All of them had incubation periods well within the 14-day window. As such, we will reduce the SHN period from 21 days back to 14 days.</p></p><p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, given the higher transmissibility of new variants of concern, and to identify potential infection cases early and provide infected travellers with appropriate medical care as soon as possible, travellers will be required to test themselves regularly with antigen rapid test (ART) self-test kits on Days 3, 7 and 11 of their arrival in Singapore, while serving their SHN [2]. This is on top of the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests they have to take on arrival in Singapore, and on Day 14 of their arrival, before they exit SHN.</p></p><p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;In summary, we will implement the following changes to the SHN regime:</p></p><p><p>a)&nbsp; &nbsp;From <strong>23 June 2021, 2359 hours</strong>, all travellers with recent travel history in the past 21 days to higher risk countries/regions immediately prior to arrival in Singapore, will only be required to complete 14 days of their SHN at dedicated SHN facilities [3]. They will undergo COVID-19 PCR tests on-arrival [4]&nbsp;and on Day 14 of their arrival. They will be allowed to end their SHN as long as they have a negative result for their PCR test on Day 14 of their arrival [5].</p></p><p><p>b)&nbsp; &nbsp;Travellers who had stayed in <strong>Taiwan and Israel</strong> in the 21 days immediately prior to arrival in Singapore were previously subjected to a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, and an additional 7-day SHN at their place of residence. From<strong> 23 June 2021, 2359 hours, </strong>travellers who had stayed in these countries/regions in the 21 days immediately prior to their arrival in Singapore will be allowed to apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities before arrival and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:</p></p><p>i) Travelled to no other country/region other than the above-mentioned countries/regions [6], in the last consecutive 21 days immediately prior to entry into Singapore; and <p><br>ii) Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.<br></p></p><p>c)&nbsp; &nbsp; Refund details are being worked out for travellers who are affected by these changes, and will be shared with them separately.<p><br>d)&nbsp; &nbsp; Besides the on-arrival PCR test and PCR test on Day 14 of arrival, all travellers [7]&nbsp;serving the SHN in dedicated SHN facilities will also undergo ART self-administered tests on Days 3, 7 and 11 of their arrival. This new requirement will be implemented for new arrivals from <strong>27 Jun 2021, 2359 hours</strong>.<br></p></p><p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Newly arrived migrant workers from higher-risk countries/regions [8]&nbsp;and staying in dormitories or working in the Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) sector will continue to go through an additional 7-day stay at the Migrant Worker Onboarding Centre (MWOC) or a dedicated facility after they are cleared from their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. This additional 7-day stay that has been in place since early this year, will include an additional testing regime, medical examination and Settling-In-Programme (SIP), where required. This precautionary measure will further minimise any small risk of imported COVID-19 positive cases transmitting the virus into the dormitories or at the worksites which can result in large clusters, and will be regularly reviewed as the COVID-19 situation evolves.<p><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; New crew from higher risk countries/regions who are entering Singapore on a long-term permit to work onboard harbour craft operating in the Port of Singapore will undergo an additional 7-day stay and testing regime at a dedicated facility after they are cleared from their 14-day SHN in Singapore before commencing work onboard the harbour craft. This will serve as a precaution in view of the essential marine services that the harbour craft provide to support our supply chain.</p></p><p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community.
