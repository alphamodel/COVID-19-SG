As of 30 December 2021, we have detected 912 Omicron imported cases; of whom 685 were detected through our enhanced testing regime for VTL travellers.</span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We previously announced that all VTL travellers [1]&nbsp;must undergo COVID-19 tests up till Day 7 of their arrival and strictly adhere to this enhanced testing regime (please see <u><a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex65d16d3f183f4601b852069e4f628dc9.pdf?sfvrsn=7bee2bf7_0\" title=\"Annex\">Annex</a></u> for testing regime) for four weeks in the first instance (until 2 January 2022). The enhancement has proven effective in detecting imported Omicron cases amongst VTL travellers and reducing onward transmission. As such, we will be extending the enhanced testing regime for an additional four weeks and will review it as the situation evolves.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We had earlier also required all non-VTL travellers entering Singapore to undergo on-arrival tests (OAT). This was to pick up the Omicron cases early, as the variant was new, and we wanted to learn more about it. As we have gathered more information on the Omicron variant, we have further assessed that OATs for non-VTL travellers, who are all required to serve a 7 or 10 day Stay Home Notice (SHN) either at their place of residence or at a dedicated facility, are no longer required. In addition, these travellers will also be required to undergo a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at the end of their SHN, and have to test negative before they are allowed to exit SHN, further reducing the risk of onward transmission. Hence, <strong>from 7 January 2022, 2359 hours (Singapore time)</strong>,<strong> </strong>all non-VTL travellers entering Singapore from Category II (non-VTL), III and IV countries will no longer be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test on-arrival.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; border: none; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><strong>Regular Review of Border Measures</strong></span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID resilient nation.
