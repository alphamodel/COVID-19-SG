CASE DETAILS
A)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today. Case 58461 is a Filipino sea
crew who arrived from the Philippines on the Normand Australis, which
docked at Tuas Port on 18 November. He had earlier been identified as a
close contact of Case 58357 ¹, and was already placed on quarantine at a
government quarantine facility since 22 November. Prior to that, he had
not disembarked from the ship.
Before boarding the ship, Case 58461 had undergone a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 2 November which came back negative. Upon the
ship’s arrival in Singapore, all 18 crew members had been swabbed on 19
November, and all of them tested negative except for Case 58357. As a
precautionary measure, the crew members were placed on quarantine, and
Case 58461 was moved to a government quarantine facility to serve his
quarantine. He is asymptomatic, and was swabbed during quarantine to
verify his status. His serological test has come back positive.
B)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C)  IMPORTED CASES: 12
Amongst the 12 imported cases, 2 (Cases 58459 and 58465) are
Singaporeans who returned from the US and Indonesia, and 4 (Cases 58460,
58462, 58469 and 58470) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned
from the US, India and Indonesia. Another 4 (Cases 58464, 58467, 58471
and 58472) are Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who
arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines. The remaining cases are a
Dependant’s Pass holder (Case 58466) who arrived from Nepal and a
Short-Term Visit Pass holder (Case 58463) who arrived from Indonesia to
visit her relatives who are Singaporeans.
Case 58465 is a Singaporean who had travelled to Indonesia under the
Business Travel Pass. He had undergone a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) test upon return to Singapore on 28 November, and
self-isolated while waiting for his test result. His test came back
negative but he developed symptoms on 2 December, and was tested for
COVID-19  when he sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner
clinic. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 4 December, and
is currently isolated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.
Prior to hospitalisation, he had gone to work at ASL Shipyard Pte Ltd
(19 Pandan Road), but had not interacted with his colleagues. His
serological test has come back negative, which indicates likely current
infection. All his identified close contacts have been isolated and
placed on quarantine.
All the other 11 imported cases had already been placed on SHN or
isolated upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or
during isolation.
3.     Please refer to the Annexesand MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     6 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,158 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.     There are currently 26 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 42 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
