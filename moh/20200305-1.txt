LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
3.             Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police
Force.
a)        Six of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33,
38, 83, 90 and 91), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life
Church and Missions Singapore. These six cases are linked to another 23

67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84, 88) who are linked to the Grace

115, 116 and 117) are linked to a private dinner function at SAFRA
Jurong on 15 February.
4.             Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition
to the clusters, our investigations have identified the following links
between cases:
·      Case 44 is linked to Cases 13 and 26;
·      Case 72 is linked to Cases 59 and 79;
·      Case 50 is linked to Cases 55, 65 and 77;
·      Case 75 is linked to Case 41; and
·      Case 86 is linked to Case 82.
5.             Contact tracing is underway for the other 12 locally
transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel
history to affected countries or regions.

HEALTH ADVISORY
21.          Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei
Province and all non-essential travel to mainland China, Iran, northern
Italy, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
22.          All travellers should monitor their health closely for two
weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if
they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.
23.          Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:
·      Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing
symptoms of illness;
·      Observe good personal hygiene;
·      Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling
food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
·      Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
shortness of breath;
·      Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing,
and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
·      Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.
24.          MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is
likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
