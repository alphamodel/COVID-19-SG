    <body><h1>No Prior Appointment Needed for Eligible Seniors Aged 60 and Above for Booster Dose</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 30 Sep 2021</p> <span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On 15 September 2021, we commenced the vaccination booster programme for persons aged 60 years and above. We have been making good progress. As of 29 September 2021, we have invited about 500,000 eligible seniors to receive their booster doses. 215,729 individuals have received their booster shots and another 119,000 have booked their appointments.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To make it more convenient for our seniors to receive their booster dose, from <strong>1 October 2021</strong>, all Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders, <strong>aged 60 years and above who have completed their second dose on 1 April 2021 or earlier</strong>, will be able to walk into any Vaccination Centre, Polyclinic, or participating Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) without a prior appointment to receive their booster dose. Other seniors aged 60 and above will be eligible to walk into any of these vaccination sites for their booster doses once they meet the recommended window of six months after their second dose.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Data from Israel's nationwide booster vaccination rollout shows that a vaccine booster dose in persons aged 60 years and above maintain strong protection against COVID-19 without additional safety concerns. We urge all seniors who are eligible for the booster programme to step forward to receive their booster dose.<br><br><strong><br>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>30 SEPTEMBER 2021</strong></span></span><br></body>
