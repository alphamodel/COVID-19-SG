Case 57947 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread. Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for his household contacts to determine if he could have been infected by them.<br></p><p>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased from an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 1 case in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 1</strong></p><p>There is 1 case residing in a dormitory, who had been identified earlier as a contact of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission.
