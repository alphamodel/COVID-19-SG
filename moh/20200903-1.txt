137 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 48 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 03 Sep 2020

1.     As of 3 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 48 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:

SUMMARY OF NEW CASES

All new cases today are asymptomatic, and were detected from our
proactive screening and surveillance.

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+



a.  IMPORTED CASES: 5 (3 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 1 Long-Term
    Visit Pass holder, 1 Work Permit holder)



    Amongst the 5 imported cases, 3 (Cases 57026, 57033 and 57034) are
    Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from
    Bangladesh on 31 August, India on 22 August and the UAE on 22
    August. Another case (Case 57014) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder
    who arrived from India on 23 August. The remaining case (Case 57035)
    is a Work Permit holder currently employed in Singapore who arrived
    from the Philippines on 22 August. All of them had been placed on
    14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had
    been tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.

b.  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (1 Permanent Resident, 1 Work Permit
    holder)



    Both cases in the community are currently unlinked and were picked
    up as a result of our proactive surveillance and screening, even
    though they are asymptomatic. Cases 57022 and 57012 were detected as
    a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the
    construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the
    dormitories. Case 57022’s serological test result has come back
    positive, indicating a likely past infection [1].

    Epidemiological investigations of the cases are in progress. In the
    meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
    isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start
    and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
    asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for their
    household contacts to determine if they could have been infected by
    them.

    Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased,
    from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average
    of 3 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the
    community has also increased, from an average of 1 case per day in
    the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. We
    will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
    detected through our surveillance programme.

c.  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 41

Amongst the 41 cases residing in dormitories, 22 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.

The remaining 19 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with acute respiratory infection (ARI)
symptoms. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic
ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections. The serological test results for 22 cases have come
back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.



2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.     Of the new cases, 96% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

4.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

5.     137 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 56,028 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.

 6.     There are currently 52 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 801 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
