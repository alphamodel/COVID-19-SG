Closure of 10 Paediatric Vaccination Centres



CLOSURE OF 10 PAEDIATRIC VACCINATION CENTRES


Published Date: 05 Apr 2022

       The Ministry of Health (MOH) had earlier announced on 24 March
2022[1] plans to reduce the number of paediatric Vaccination Centres
(VCs) from 12 to two, as most of the 5 to 11-year-olds would have
completed their primary vaccination series. Hence, 10 paediatric VCs
will cease operations on 30 April 2022. With the closures, two
paediatric VCs at Hougang Community Club and Senja-Cashew Community Club
will remain in operation.
2.    MOH will progressively onboard selected Public Health Preparedness
Clinics and Polyclinics to provide paediatric vaccine doses to children
who have yet to receive their primary vaccination series. Further
details on this will be announced later.
3.    Since the extension of the National Vaccination Programme to
include children aged 5 to 11, we have seen good uptake of vaccinations
among this age group. As of 3 April 2022, 79% of these children have
either booked an appointment for or received their first dose, while 66%
have received their second dose.
4.     Among the students in our primary schools, 85% have received at
least their first dose, while 74% have received both doses. In addition,
about 33,000 children born in 2016 and 2017 have registered on MOH’s
National Appointment System. More than 30,000 have received at least
their first dose, while about 23,000 have received their second dose.
5.     The following paediatric VCs will have their last day of
operations on 30 April 2022:

·  Arena@Our Tampines Hub

·  Clementi Community Centre

·  Former Hong Kah Secondary School

·  Jalan Besar Community Club

·  Marine Parade Community Club

·  Nee Soon East Community Club

·  Pasir Ris Elias Community Club

·  The Serangoon Community Club

·  Toa Payoh West Community Club

·  Woodlands Galaxy Community Club
6.      These VCs will accept appointments made via the National
Appointment System for paediatric Dose 1 appointments up to 9 April 2022
and paediatric Dose 2 until 30 April 2022. Parents/guardians who wish to
walk in for their child/ward’s Dose 1 appointments at any of the 10 VCs
should also do so by 9 April 2022.
7.      We urge parents/guardians to take full advantage of the capacity
and good geographical spread of our VCs while they are still in
operation over the coming month. Vaccinations remain a critical part of
our strategy in ensuring our children are well protected against severe
illness should they be infected with COVID-19. The list of vaccination
centres can be found at www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs.
