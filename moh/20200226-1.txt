Published Date: 26 Feb 2020

            Four more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospital today (Cases 49, 56, 59 and 73). In all, 62 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.
2.          As of 26 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
has confirmed and verified two more cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. Contact tracing is underway for these cases to establish any
links to previous cases or travel history to China.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
3.          Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This
was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
a)    Six of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38,
83, 90 and 91), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church
and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). These six cases are
linked to another 23 confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58,
60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84, 88) who are
linked to the Grace Assembly of God.
b)    Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34
and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).
c)    Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to
the business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22
January.
d)    Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are
linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.
4.          Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to
the clusters, our investigations have identified the following links
between cases:

-   Case 44 is linked to Cases 13 and 26;
-   Case 72 is linked to Cases 59 and 79;
-   Case 50 is linked to Cases 55, 65 and 77;
-   Case 75 is linked to Case 41; and
-   Case 86 is linked to Case 82.

5.          Contact tracing is underway for the other 11 locally
transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel
history to mainland China.

infection and have been discharged from hospital. Of the 31 confirmed
cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving. Seven are
in critical condition in the intensive care unit.
UPDATE ON CONTACT TRACING FOR CONFIRMED CASES
9.          Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once
identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a
precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their
last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts
who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.
10.          As of 26 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 2,848
close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 259 are currently
quarantined, and 2,589 have completed their quarantine.
HEALTH ADVISORY
11.          Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei
Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China, and Daegu city
and Cheongdo county in the Republic of Korea. MOH also reminds the
public to continue to exercise caution when travelling to the rest of
the Republic of Korea.
12.          All travellers should monitor their health closely for two
weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if
they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.
13.          Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
    respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

14.          MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is
likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
