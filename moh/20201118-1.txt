3.  Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.

4.  Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

5.  MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at
ASPRI-Westlite Papan (5 Jalan Papan) for the past two incubation periods
(i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.

from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,046 have
