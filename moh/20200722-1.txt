Published Date: 22 Jul 2020

      As of 22 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 310 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 6 (3 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 3 Work Pass
holders)
Amongst the imported cases, 3 (Cases 48551, 48552 and 48821) are
Singaporeans/Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India on
12 July, and from Kazakhstan on 10 July. The remaining 3 (Cases 48535,
48579 and 48820) are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in
Singapore. They arrived in Singapore from the Philippines on 8 July and
10 July. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN)
upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 7 (3 Singaporeans, 3 Work Pass holders, 1
Work Permit holder)
Of the 7 cases in the community, 6 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. 6 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected
through our proactive testing.
2 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters.
Of these, 1 (Case 48550) had been identified as a contact of a
previously confirmed case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier.
She was tested during quarantine to determine her status, even though
she is asymptomatic. The remaining case (Case 48695) was swabbed as part
of our efforts to screen individuals working in frontline COVID-19
operations, and had been detected before symptoms onset.
5 of the community cases are currently unlinked. All of them were
detected from our proactive screening of workers in essential services
who are living outside the dormitories, even though they are
asymptomatic.
Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to
determine if these cases could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 13 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 9 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 8 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 5 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
c) Cases residing in dormitories: 297
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 98% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.      The Inter-Agency Task Force has been systematically and
progressively clearing dormitories through aggressive testing of migrant
workers residing in dormitories. The following dormitories have been
cleared, and now house only recovered individuals and those who have
recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As such, the clusters
have now been closed.

-   Cochrane Lodge II (49 Admiralty Road West);

-   Hulett Dormitory (20 Senoko Drive);

-   Shaw Lodge (12 Shaw Road);

-   Tampines Dormitory (2 Tampines Place);

-   31 Sungei Kadut Avenue; and

-   230 Woodlands Industrial Park E5.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.      In the past week (15 July to 21 July), MOH has uncovered links
for 2 previously unlinked cases in the community.
6.      Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.     211 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 44,795 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.      There are currently 150 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 3,772 are isolated and cared for at community
