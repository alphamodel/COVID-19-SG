There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today. Case 58443 is
asymptomatic, and was detected through our proactive surveillance. His
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test yielded a very high Ct value, which
is indicative of a low viral load. All his close contacts at the

Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.
3.         Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.

5.      1 more case of COVID-19 infection has been discharged from
hospital. In all, 58,145 have fully recovered from the infection and
have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.
6.       There are currently 26 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 39 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
