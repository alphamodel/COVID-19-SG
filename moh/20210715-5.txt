Bringing Covid-19 Vaccination to the Heartlands for Seniors



BRINGING COVID-19 VACCINATION TO THE HEARTLANDS FOR SENIORS


Published Date: 15 Jul 2021

          The government will be intensifying our outreach to encourage
the rest of our seniors to be vaccinated. This is critical as seniors
are the most vulnerable group and at higher risk of becoming dangerously
ill if infected with COVID-19. With age and possibly underlying health
conditions, their immune system is weaker. Without vaccination, they may
not be able to fight off the virus.
2.          Currently about 7 in 10 seniors aged 70 and above have
completed at least their first vaccination dose.  To enhance convenience
for seniors, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will launch up to 10 mobile
vaccination teams to the heartlands. These mobile vaccination teams will
be deployed at locations near where many seniors live, such as at
selected Community Clubs/Centres (CCs) that are not already being used
as Vaccination Centres, or at the Residents’ Committee centres at
residential blocks. The mobile vaccination team deployment will be done
in phases, and has started with Anchorvale CC on 7 July 2021. It will be
progressively deployed at Kallang, Whampoa, Changi Simei and Paya Lebar
Kovan CCs in the coming weeks.
3.          The mobile vaccination teams will be deployed at each
location for a few days to a week, before moving to other locations, and
returning to the original location to administer the second vaccination
dose. This is to ensure that those who had receive the first dose will
get their second dose at the same location.
4.          The deployment location and schedule of the mobile
vaccination teams in are as follows:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|  DATE (FOR 1ST DOSE)              | LOCATION                          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|  7 July to 13 July                |  Anchorvale CC                    |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|  14 July to 21 July               |  Kallang CC                       |
| (closed on 20 July for Hari Raya  |  Whampoa CC                       |
| Haji)                             |                                   |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|  22 July to 28 July               |  Changi Simei CC                  |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|  29 July to 4 August              |  Paya Lebar Kovan CC              |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

5.          MOH will also call on our primary care providers,
including private general practitioners and polyclinics, to help in this
national effort. First, we will expand the number of Public Health
Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) providing COVID-19 vaccination as part of
the national vaccination programme, starting with Bedok, Bukit Merah,
Hougang and Tampines in the coming weeks. All primary care providers
have also been called on to help persuade seniors who are their regular
patients, to go for their COVID-19 vaccination if they have not done so
yet.
6.          Staff and volunteers from the PA and AIC’s outreach arm,
Silver Generation Office (SGO) will also intensify their ground outreach
efforts. They will reach out to the unvaccinated seniors through house
visits and engagement dialogues to address any queries or concerns they
might have. They will also provide advice on the nearest vaccination
locations and assist those who require help in getting to the
vaccination centres, or arrange for them to be vaccinated at home if
they are homebound.
7.          We strongly urge seniors to be vaccinated by these mobile
vaccination teams as they are deployed to a location near to them, to
protect themselves, their senior friends and their loved ones. Seniors
aged 60 years old and above may also walk into any of the existing
Vaccination Centres with their Identity Card to receive their first dose
of vaccination, without any prior appointment needed, or visit their
doctors at any of the participating PHPCs or polyclinics. Homebound
persons can also directly request to receive their vaccination at home,
by calling the SGO hotline at 1800-650-6060. To target this service to
seniors who really need it, this service will be strictly reserved for
those who are homebound.
8.          Vaccination remains a key enabler in our fight against
COVID-19. Together, we can help Singapore to re-open safely if we each
contribute to achieve a high level of population vaccination coverage.
We encourage all who have yet to be vaccinated, to register your
interest via vaccine.gov.sg and book your appointment to get vaccinated.
