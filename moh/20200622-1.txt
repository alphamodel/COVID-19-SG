      As of 22 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 218 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Work Permit holder)
There are no Singaporean/ Permanent Resident cases today.
The single case in the community had been picked up as a result of our
proactive screening of those working in essential services, even though
he is asymptomatic.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 8 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 217
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
