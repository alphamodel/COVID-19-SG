This is to protect the healthcare capacity, as well as vulnerable patients and residents during this period when COVID-19 cases in the community are rising.<br><br><strong>In-person Visits at Hospitals<br></strong><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All patients will be allowed only two pre-designated visitors for the duration of their admission, and only one visitor may be allowed at the bedside at any one time. Critically ill patients will be allowed up to five pre-designated patients, and two visitors may be allowed at the bedside at any one point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The visit duration will be limited to 30 minutes. In exceptional situations, such as for critically ill patients, paediatric patients, birthing or post-partum mothers, and for patients requiring additional care support<sup>2</sup>, visitors may be allowed to stay beyond 30 minutes on a case-by-case basis at the hospitals\u2019 discretion.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards, or use the toilets designated for patients in the wards. They should avoid sitting on patients\u2019 beds.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, as our hospitals\u2019 Emergency Departments (ED) are seeing a high number of patients daily, we encourage members of public to only go to the ED for emergency conditions. To prioritise ED resources for patients who need emergency medical care, ED patients with non-emergency conditions, including children, may be diverted to other urgent care clinics or primary care clinics for further assessment.<br><strong><br>In-person Visits at Homes<br></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All residents will be allowed up to four pre-designated visitors, and only one visitor may visit at any one time with the visit duration limited to 30 minutes. Visitors should continue to schedule the visits with the Home ahead of time. Visitors should strictly adhere to prevailing safe management measures within the Homes. This includes remaining within the designated visitor areas, outside of the wards.<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We also seek the understanding of visitors that visits may have to be suspended if a Home is managing active COVID-19 cases. Next-of-kin of residents may approach the Home for further details.<br><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visitors to hospitals and Homes are to ensure that they are well and are strongly encouraged to test themselves with an antigen rapid test (ART) kit on the day of the visit to their loved ones. They must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. Hospitals and Homes have the discretion to impose stricter visitor limits or testing requirements for visitors of vulnerable or unvaccinated patients.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MOH will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line with the evolving COVID-19 situation. We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients, residents, and their family members and loved ones as we work to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our healthcare institutions.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;<br>12 OCTOBER 2022</strong><br><div><br><br><sup>1</sup> Including public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals.<br><sup>2</sup> Patients who require additional care support, such as patients who have mental incapacities, or family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better care for their loved ones after hospital discharge</div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "limitations-on-in-person-visits-to-hospitals-and-residential-care-homes", "CurrentPageUrl": null, "CustomPressWidgetLocationUrl": null}, {"Title": "Public Consultation On Proposed Amendments to the Healthcare Services Act ", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1665567000000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "12 Oct 2022", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Ministry of Health (MOH) is inviting views and feedback on the proposed amendments to the Healthcare Services Act (HCSA) to strengthen safeguards for patient safety and welfare. The HCSA amendments are targeted for implementation in June 2023.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HCSA was enacted in 2020 to replace the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA) to better safeguard patient safety and wellbeing in the changing healthcare environment, while enabling the development of new and innovative healthcare services. The Act is being implemented progressively in three phases, which started in January 2022 and will be completed in end-2023 when the PHMCA will be repealed [1].</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Over the past two years, we have engaged extensively with various stakeholders and noted several areas of enhancements for the regulatory framework. Under the proposed amendments, patients will benefit from the delivery of healthcare services by licensees under a robust regulatory regime, and from greater clarity and transparency in healthcare services advertising and modes of service delivery.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH proposes the following enhancements to HCSA, which will enable patients to benefit from a robust regulatory regime governing healthcare services delivered through different modes, and to have greater clarity and transparency in healthcare services advertising.</p><p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertising of healthcare services not licensed under HCSA</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-HCSA licensees cannot claim to treat medical conditions or diseases when advertising healthcare services.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-registered healthcare professionals who use the title of \u201cDr\u201d in their advertisement of healthcare services must make clear to the public what their qualifications and credentials are, so that the public are not misled that the \u201cDr\u201d is one associated with a general medical practice (e.g. with a MBBS Degree).</p><p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of specialty names in business names</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HCSA licensees are not allowed to use terms associated with specialties in their business names if there is no such specialist employed by them. e.g. a clinic cannot be called a \u201cNeurology Clinic\u201d if there is no neurologist working in the clinic.</p><p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulation of different modes of healthcare service delivery</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different modes of service delivery will be introduced for each healthcare service (as appropriate to the service) so that the public is aware of the modes of service delivery they can access. e.g. a medical clinic can choose \u201cPermanent Premises\u201d for its clinic service delivered at its brick and mortar physical premises, \u201cTemporary Premises\u201d for providing home visits or community site screenings, and \u201cRemote\u201d for teleconsultations, if it wishes to provide those modes of services.</p><p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safeguarding the provision of healthcare services by introducing an approval regime for the delivery of specified services (e.g. imaging modalities under the Radiological Service) and the appointment of clinical governance officers.</p><p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refining the scope of employee background screening according to the degree of risk to patients\u2019 safety and welfare.</p><p>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allowing MOH to take immediate action to address urgent patient safety issues by removing the 14-day notice prior to modification of licence conditions for groups of licensees in such special circumstances, e.g. requiring licensees to implement screening requirements for patients and caregivers to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In particular, MOH is seeking views from a) the general public, b) licensees who have already come onboard HCSA in Phase 1, and c) healthcare providers who may take up HCSA licences in the future. The feedback gathered from the public consultation will better inform the implementation of HCSA in subsequent phases.</p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For licensees who are coming onboard HCSA in Phase 2, details on specific HCSA requirements will be provided separately at the respective service regulation consultations in the next few months.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone has a part to play to improve and safeguard patient safety and welfare. The amendments are targeted for implementation in June 2023. &nbsp;From 12 October to 11 November 2022, members of the public are invited to visit <a href=\"http://www.hsca.sg\">www.hsca.sg</a> to provide their feedback on the proposed changes to HCSA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>12 OCTOBER 2022</strong></p><div><br clear=\"all\"><hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><div id=\"ftn1\"><p>[1] HCSA has been implemented on 3 January 2022 for clinical support services such as clinical laboratory and blood banking, emergency ambulance and medical transport services, General Regulations and Advertisement Regulations.
