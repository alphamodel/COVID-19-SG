The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to take action to reduce individuals' intake of sugar to as low as possible, stating that \"nutritionally, people do not need any sugar in their diet\". However, Singaporeans are consuming on average 12 teaspoons (or 60g) of sugar daily. More than half of Singaporeans\u2019 daily sugar intake comes from beverages, of which prepacked beverages contribute 64 percent. This is a concern, and more needs to be done to reduce Singaporeans\u2019 sugar intake.</span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced the decision to introduce labelling requirements and advertising prohibitions on 10 October 2019,&nbsp;after carefully considering the feedback received from public, industry and expert stakeholders, and reviewing existing overseas and local evidence.</span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0px; font-size: small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Amendment Regulations aim to (a) help consumers identify beverages that are higher in sugar and saturated fat and make more informed, healthier choices; (b) reduce the influence of advertising on consumer preferences, and (c) spur industry reformulation.</span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0px; font-size: small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Amendment Regulations are summarised as follows.
