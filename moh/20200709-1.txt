322 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 125 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 09 Jul 2020

        As of 9 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 125 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 1 (1 Permanent Resident)
There is an imported case today involving a Singapore Permanent Resident
who returned to Singapore from India on 23 June. She had been placed on
14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been
tested while serving SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 21 (4 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 3
Work Pass holders, 14 Work Permit holders)
Of the 21 cases in the community, 11 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 5 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. 15 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were all
detected through our proactive testing.
10 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or
clusters. Of these, 5 (Cases 45369, 45370, 45371, 45420 and 45465) had
been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been
tested during their quarantine to determine their status. The remaining
5 cases (Cases 45357, 45358, 45361, 45362 and 45366) are all
asymptomatic, and were detected as a result of our proactive screening
of workers in essential services.
11 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 6 cases were
detected from our proactive testing. 4 of them (Cases 45360, 45364,
45365 and 45422) were tested as they work in essential services, even
though they are asymptomatic. The other 2 cases (Cases 45356 and 45363)
were swabbed as part of our efforts to screen individuals working in
frontline COVID-19 operations. Of the remaining cases, 4 (Cases 45345,
45347, 45354 and 45373) were swabbed under our enhanced community
testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with
acute respiratory infection at first presentation to a doctor. This
allows us to detect infected individuals early and to quickly contain
further spread. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for these
cases, as well as the remaining case (Case 45379).
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 16 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 8 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 103
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 91% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.        We announced on 2 July that MOH has placed 58 households
residing at Block 111 Tampines Street 11 under active phone surveillance
and would be facilitating COVID-19 testing for them and their visitors.
This is a precautionary measure after MOH had detected 9 confirmed cases
from 2 households residing at the block. All infected individuals from
these 2 households have been isolated earlier and are recovering in
hospitals or community care facilities. In total, 123 residents and
visitors have been tested so far, and all the results have come back
negative for COVID-19. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing, but
thus far there is no evidence of spread beyond the 2 households. MOH
will continue to closely monitor the situation.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.       In the past week (2 July to 8 July), MOH has uncovered links
for 3 previously unlinked cases.
6.      Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.      322 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 41,645 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.        There are currently 197 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 3,554 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 26 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
9.      Case 43688, a 38 year-old male Bangladeshi national, has passed
away on 7 July 2020. He had been conveyed to Ng Teng Fong General
Hospital on 28 June after suffering a seizure, and subsequently
developed intracranial haemorrhage. He was confirmed to have COVID-19
infection on 28 June. The preliminary cause of death is
cardiorespiratory failure, pending further investigations by the
Coroner. ¹
