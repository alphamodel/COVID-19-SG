A)  IMPORTED CASES: 4 (1 Singaporean, 1 Permanent Resident, 2 Work
Permit holders)
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 1 (Case 57897) is a Singaporean and
another (Case 57890) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned to
Singapore from India on 12 September and Indonesia on 25 September. The
remaining 2 (Cases 57907 and 57908) are Work Permit holders currently
employed in Singapore who arrived from the Philippines on 18 September.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3 (3 Work Permit holders)
Of the 3 cases in the community, 2 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. 2 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected
through our proactive testing.
1 of the community cases today is linked to previous cases. Case 57911
had been identified as a contact of previously confirmed cases, and had
been placed on quarantine earlier. He was tested during quarantine to
determine his status, even though he is asymptomatic.
The other 2 community cases are currently unlinked. Case 57889 was
detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the
construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the
dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic. Case 57906 was detected
under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and
above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first
presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify infected
individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.
Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to
determine if they could have been infected by them
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an
average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 16
Amongst the 16 cases residing in dormitories, 10 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 6 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH's daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.  Of the new cases, 87% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
4.  MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Cochrane Lodge
II (49 Admiralty Road West) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28
days), the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.  22 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,488 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.  There are currently 41 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 209 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
