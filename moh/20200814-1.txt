         As of 14 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 83 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 4 (2 Work Pass holders, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders)
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 2 (Cases 55580 and 55606) are Dependant’s
Pass holders who arrived from India on 30 July and 31 July. The
remaining cases (Cases 55637 and 55650) arrived from India on 2 August.
They are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in Singapore. All
of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in
Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had
been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 79
The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in
the dormitories. There are currently about 21,300 workers who are still
serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when
their quarantine ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in
the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.
