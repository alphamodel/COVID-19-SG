Case 59243 is a Work Permit holder who arrived from India on 11 December 2020, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 25 December. His swab done on 21 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">He resides at Seatown Dormitory and started work in the construction sector on 6 January 2021. He tested negative again for COVID-19 on 27 December. However a subsequent test taken on 12 January as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) came back positive for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result is positive.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">Given the relatively long time interval between his travel and positive COVID-19 test, we have classified this case as locally transmitted while epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including his dormitory contacts and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 37<br><br></strong>Amongst the 37 imported cases,</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">3 (Cases 59222, 59237 and 59240) are Singaporeans and 5 (Cases 59220, 59221, 59223, 59241 and 59242) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from France, India, Indonesia, the UK and US.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">1 (Case 59210) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Indonesia.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">4 (Cases 59214, 59218, 59239 and 59245) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India and the UAE.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">21 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines, of whom 8 (Cases 59224, 59226, 59227, 59228, 59231, 59233, 59234 and 59246) are foreign domestic workers.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">3 (Cases 59235, 59236 and 59238) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders.
