CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to previous cases.
Case 61917, a 44 year-old male Papua New Guinea national, is a
Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Australia on 25 March for
a work project here. His pre-departure test done in Australia on 23
March was negative for COVID-19, as was his on-arrival test in Singapore
on 25 March. Thereafter he had remained isolated until another COVID-19
test taken on 27 March came back negative. Subsequently he was on a
controlled itinerary, which was largely limited to his place of work and
accommodation. Another test done on 31 March also came back negative for
COVID-19.
As he had been identified as a close contact of Cases 61461 and 61470,
he was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 1 April. His swab
done on 2 April during quarantine was negative for COVID-19. He is
asymptomatic, but another test taken on 12 April during quarantine came
back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed
to a hospital via an ambulance. His serology test result is pending.
We have classified this case as locally transmitted as he had repeatedly
tested negative for COVID-19 before 12 April. He was likely to have been
infected through his exposure to Cases 61461 and 61470 during the course
of their work.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 26
Amongst the 26 imported cases,
-  1 (Case 61924) is a Singaporean and 4 (Cases 61902, 61907, 61918 and
61925) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India and the
Philippines.
-  1 (Case 61911) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from Sri
Lanka.
-  2 (Cases 61914 and 61932) are Work Pass holders who arrived from
India and Nepal.
-  17 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and
Indonesia, of whom 4 (Cases 61927, 61931, 61934 and 61936) are foreign
domestic workers.
-  1 (Case 61915) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who is a sea crew.
He arrived from the Philippines to board a vessel in Singapore, and had
remained onboard until he developed symptoms and was conveyed to a
hospital.
They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.
4.     Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.    18 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,392 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.    There are currently 61 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 2 are in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 236 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
