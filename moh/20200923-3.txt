PILOT OF ADDITIONAL ROUTINE COVID TESTS TO DETECT ASYMPTOMATIC CASES EARLY


Published Date: 23 Sep 2020

             The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry of Health (MOH)
will be undertaking additional routine testing for COVID-19 at Toh Guan
Dormitory, as a pilot to understand how more frequent testing will
enable earlier detection of asymptomatic cases among migrant workers.

2  Currently, all migrant workers staying in dormitories need to
undergo Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) every 14 days.  This is part of a
multi-layered strategy for effective prevention of new infections. Over
a period of four weeks from 25 September 2020, MOM and MOH will be
piloting an additional round of testing, on top of the existing 14 day
RRT cycle for residents in the dormitory. This will effectively increase
the testing frequency to a 7 day cycle. New infections can then be
detected earlier, and the spread contained more quickly.

3  To minimise the impact on the work schedule of the migrant
workers, the pilot will be conducted within the dormitory. Instead of
the usual nasopharyngeal swab, a new Oropharynx/ Mid-turbinate nasal
method of swabbing will be used. This method of swabbing will be more
comfortable for the workers.

4  With the earlier detection of new infections, MOM may not
require the entire block of the dormitory to be quarantined should there
be a COVID-19 positive case, as long as Safe Living Measures are
complied with.  This will enable a more targeted quarantine approach
that will minimise the disruption to workers and employers.
