MORE THAN $164 MILLION DISBURSED TO NEEDY SINGAPOREANS THROUGH MEDIFUND IN FY2021


Published Date: 30 Nov 2022

     The Medical Endowment Fund (MediFund) provided a total of $164.1
million in assistance through more than 1.2 million successful
applications to support needy Singaporeans for their medical bills in
Financial Year (FY) 2021, i.e., for the period 1 April 2021 to 31 March
2022.

2.     MediFund is a safety net for needy Singaporean patients who are
unable to afford their remaining medical bills, after government
subsidies and drawing on other means of payment including MediShield
Life and MediSave. MediFund Silver and MediFund Junior were introduced
in 2007 and 2013 respectively to provide more targeted assistance for
the elderly and children respectively. MediFund ensures that no
Singaporean will be denied access to basic medical care due to inability
to pay.
3.     The amount of MediFund assistance in FY2021 was $7.2 million
higher than the $156.9 million in FY2020. The increase in assistance was
mainly due to an increased number of patient visits to the Public
Healthcare Institutions (PHIs) with the easing of COVID-19 safe
management measures in FY2021. The key statistics of MediFund assistance
provided in FY2021 are:



(i)  The number of approved MediFund applications was 1,236,587.
This was a 7.4% increase from the 1,150,985 number of approved
applications in FY2020, in tandem with a 5.7% increase in the total
number of applications over the same period;



(ii)  In PHIs, the total amount of assistance provided to patients
was $128.6 million, compared to $120.3 million in FY2020;



(iii)  In Intermediate and Long-Term Care facilities, the total
amount of assistance provided to patients was $35.5 million, compared to
$36.6 million in FY2020; and



(iv)  On average, the amount of MediFund assistance provided was
$912 per inpatient treatment, and $95 per outpatient treatment.
