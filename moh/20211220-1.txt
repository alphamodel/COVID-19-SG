    The Ministry of Health (MOH) has detected a cluster of three
COVID-19 cases linked to Anytime Fitness (Bukit Timah Shopping Centre),
of whom two have tested preliminarily positive for the Omicron variant
and the result for the remaining case is pending. All three cases are
fully vaccinated and have mild symptoms. MOH is ringfencing the cases
through contact tracing.

sore throat and fever on 18 December 2021 and sought medical attention

chain reaction (PCR) test. His test result came back positive for
COVID-19 infection on the same day.
Case 280951

3.  Case 280951is an 18 year-old female who is a student at Ngee Ann
Polytechnic, and was last in school on 15 December. She developed a sore
throat and fever on 18 December and sought medical attention at a GP

Global Chef Academy but had not been to school recently. He developed a
sore throat on 18 December and sought medical attention at a GP clinic
where he was tested for COVID-19. His PCR test result came back positive
for COVID-19 infection on 19 December.
5.  All three cases had no recent travel history. Our epidemiological
investigations found that they recently visited Anytime Fitness (Bukit
Timah Shopping Centre) between 15 December and 17 December 2021.
6.  Staff and visitors of Anytime Fitness (Bukit Timah Shopping
Centre)who are identified to be close contacts of the cases will be
placed on quarantine. As a precautionary measure, other visitors to the
gym between 15 December and 17 December will be issued Health Risk
Warnings (HRW). They will also be contacted by MOH for a one-time
targeted PCR test.
7.  All visitors to the affected premises are advised to monitor their
health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for
14 days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to see a doctor
immediately if they feel unwell.
8.  To date, there are 71 confirmed Omicron cases detected in Singapore,
with 65 imported cases and 6local cases. Given its high transmissibility
and spread to many parts of the world, we should expect to find more
Omicron cases at our borders and also within our community. It is
important for everyone to continue to play their part and remain
vigilant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and to come forward to
receive your vaccination or booster dose when offered.
