While the public consultation on the proposed benefit enhancements is ongoing, the Government has committed about $2.2 billion for premium subsidies and support over the next three years to help Singapore Residents with their MediShield Life premiums, particularly in view of the impact of COVID-19 on Singapore Residents and the economy. With these support measures, the net premium increases for all Singapore Citizens will be kept to up to about 10% in the first year.<br><br><strong>Existing Premium Support Measures&nbsp;<br></strong><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since 2015, the Government has provided the following to keep premiums affordable for Singaporeans:<br><br>a. Funding to cover the bulk of the cost of bringing those who were previously uninsured into MediShield Life, to ease the shift to universal coverage;<br>b. Premium subsidies of up to 50% for the lower- to middle-income;&nbsp;<br>c. Additional Merdeka Generation (MG) subsidies of 5% or 10%&nbsp; (from 2019 onwards);<br>d. Special Pioneer Generation (PG) subsidies of 40% to 60%1;&nbsp;<br>e. Transitional Subsidies for all Singapore Citizens for the first four years; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>f. Additional Premium Support (APS) to help the needy pay for their premiums.<br><br>A total of $3.1 billion has been spent over the past four years to help Singapore Residents with their premiums.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Moving forward, the Government will continue to provide premium support through premium subsidies, MG/PG subsidies and APS, estimated at about $1.8 billion over the next three years, after taking into account the preliminary premium adjustments. Additionally, PG and MG seniors currently receive annual MediSave top-ups which can be used to pay for their MediShield Life premiums. MG seniors receive $200 annually from 2019 to 2023. PG seniors receive $200 to $800 annually, for life.<br><br><strong>One-off COVID-19 Subsidy<br></strong><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To further cushion the impact of the proposed premium adjustments during this exceptional period, the Government will provide a one-off COVID-19 subsidy for all Singapore Citizens. The Government will subsidise 70% of the net increase in premiums (after taking into account existing premium subsidies) in the first year, followed by 30% in the second year.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The one-off COVID-19 subsidy will cost about $360 million over the next two years. Taken together with the existing premium support measures, the net premium increases for all Singapore Citizens will be kept to up to about 10% in the first year.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong said, \u201cSince its launch, MediShield Life has improved protection against large hospitalisation bills, and provided greater assurance for Singaporeans. The current premium subsidies for lower-to middle-income Singapore Residents, MG and PG seniors and Additional Premium Support will continue to help keep premiums affordable for Singaporeans. This will amount to about $1.8 billion over the next three years. Given the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, the Government will provide an additional $360 million through the one-off COVID-19 subsidy to help Singaporeans with their premiums during this exceptional period. In total, we have budgeted about $2.2 billion for premium subsidies and support over the next three years. Singaporeans who still face difficulties with their premiums can apply for Additional Premium Support. No one will lose MediShield Life coverage due to financial difficulties.\u201d<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-a7eebc4edb05b4a61b0cc003ac8757a7b.pdf?sfvrsn=978c0457_0\" title=\"Annex A\">Annex A</a>&nbsp;for additional details on net indicative premiums after taking into account these additional Government support.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;<br>29 SEPTEMBER 2020</strong><br></p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "government-to-provide-about-2-2-billion-to-help-singaporeans-with-medishield-life-premium-adjustments", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "Public Consultation On Medishield Life Review", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1601373600000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "29 Sep 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As part of an ongoing review of MediShield Life benefits and premiums, the MediShield Life Council will conduct a public consultation to seek views from the public on the preliminary recommendations and suggestions for enhancements to the scheme. The public consultation will be held from 29 September to 20 October 2020.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Keeping healthcare affordable for Singaporeans<br></strong><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MediShield Life is a basic health insurance plan launched in November 2015 to protect all Singaporeans against large medical bills regardless of pre-existing conditions, for life. The MediShield Life Council was appointed by the Minister for Health to provide recommendations on the policy and scheme parameters of MediShield Life, and to review its administration. This is the first major review of the scheme since its launch, and the changes are expected to be implemented in early 2021.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs Fang Ai Lian, Chairman of the MediShield Life Council said, \u201cMediShield Life plays a key role in ensuring our healthcare services remain affordable and gives Singaporeans greater peace of mind. We have to periodically review and update the scheme benefits and premiums to keep pace with evolving medical practice, healthcare cost inflation and actual claims experience, so that it continues to provide assurance for Singaporeans while remaining sustainable. As the Council undertakes the review, we invite Singaporeans to share their ideas and views through the public consultation so that MediShield Life will continue to benefit policyholders.\u201d<br><br><strong>Preliminary recommendations from the MediShield Life Council<br></strong><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MediShield Life was designed based on two key considerations: (a) provide better protection to Singaporeans, while (b) keeping premiums affordable. These considerations must be balanced carefully, as payouts are ultimately funded through premiums to ensure that MediShield Life remains sustainable.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Guided by these considerations, the MediShield Life Council has identified preliminary enhancements in three broad areas:<br><br><strong><em>(a) Refreshing and refining claim limits to provide better coverage&nbsp;<br></em></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MediShield Life claim limits should be refreshed to cover 9 in 10 subsidised bills, and should be reviewed more regularly to ensure that they offer adequate protection in light of inflation and medical advancements. In addition, the Council proposes the following refinements:<br><br>i. I<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">ntroduce treatment-specific claim limits for community hospital care and outpatient radiotherapy</span> to improve coverage for patients receiving sub-acute care [1] or costlier outpatient radiotherapy.<br><br>ii. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Raise the policy year claim limit from $100,000 to $150,000</span>, to better protect Singaporeans against exceptionally large bills arising from long or multiple periods of hospitalisation during the year.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>(b) Enhancements to support larger healthcare transformation&nbsp;<br></em></strong><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; In line with larger healthcare transformation efforts to keep healthcare costs sustainable, the MediShield Life Council recommends enhancements to better support Singaporeans who can be more appropriately cared for in the community or at home, to reduce the need for expensive hospital care:&nbsp;<br><br>i. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Introduce higher claim limits for daily ward and treatment charges for the first two days of acute hospital stay</span>, as higher charges tend to be incurred during the first two days due to diagnostic tests and investigations. This is to better support patients who can be discharged home earlier.&nbsp;<br><br>ii. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lower the deductible [2] for day surgeries for older patients,</span> so that they are not discouraged from choosing a day surgery over an inpatient stay.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>(c) Other proposed enhancements&nbsp;<br></em></strong><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The MediShield Life Council also proposes other enhancements:<br><br>i. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lower the pro-ration factor [3] for private hospitals to 25%</span>, to better reflect the actual charges and ensure greater parity in payouts between subsidised and private patients.<br><br>ii. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Remove the standard exclusions for treatments arising from attempted suicide, intentional self-injury, drug addiction and alcoholism,</span> as treatment plays an increasingly important part in the support and recovery of these patients.<br><br><strong>Review of premiums and premium affordability<br></strong><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Premiums need to be adjusted periodically to support enhancements that provide better coverage and higher payouts, and to keep pace with healthcare cost inflation and actual claims experience. In particular, MediShield Life payouts have increased by close to 40% over the last four years, and the number of claimants has increased by almost 30%. The MediShield Life Council recommends adjusting the premiums this round as proposed by the actuary to ensure that the scheme continues to be sustainable.&nbsp;<br><br>10.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As MediShield Life premiums had been kept constant for the first five years in line with the Government\u2019s commitment, premiums were not adjusted when several benefit enhancements were implemented from 2018 to 2020. This round of adjustments will also take these enhancements into account.&nbsp;<br><br>11.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Premium subsidies and support will continue to be extended to lower- and middle-income households, Merdeka Generation and Pioneer Generation seniors. Premiums will continue to be fully payable through MediSave. Total household premiums after subsidies will be within annual MediSave contributions and inflows for most typical households.&nbsp;<br><br>12.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nonetheless, the Council notes that some Singaporeans may face greater challenges with their premiums given the impact of COVID-19, and has asked the Ministry of Health (MOH) to consider providing additional assistance during this exceptional period. The Council is pleased to note that MOH has committed additional support for Singaporeans over the next two years. No one will lose MediShield Life coverage due to financial difficulties.<br>&nbsp;<br>13.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-adacb69218d94403dbf35d4e22721e3cf.pdf?sfvrsn=d3182cd2_0\" title=\"Annex A\">Annex A</a>&nbsp;for additional details on the preliminary recommendations, and <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-bbca4584ca2894522ae405c3cedbc2e4f.pdf?sfvrsn=c382b929_0\" title=\"Annex B\">Annex B</a>&nbsp;for illustrations of how the preliminary recommendations can improve coverage for patients.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Details on Public Consultation<br></strong><br>14.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The MediShield Life Council would like to invite the public to contribute their views and feedback on the preliminary recommendations.
