Published Date: 21 Jun 2020

     As of 21 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 262 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 10¹ (3 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 3
Work Pass holders, 4 Work Permit holders)
Of the 10 cases in the community, 8 had been picked up as a result of
our proactive surveillance and screening, and the remaining 2 had
already been placed on quarantine earlier.
Amongst the 3 Singaporean/Permanent Resident cases, 1 (Case 41884) was
tested as part of our proactive screening of students² at our Institutes
of Higher Learning who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection
(ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. He is a student at Nanyang
Technological University, but has not gone to the university since early
April 2020. The remaining 2 cases (Cases 41956 and 42115) had been
detected due to our proactive surveillance of persons working or living
at dormitories, even though they are asymptomatic.
All 7 Work Pass/ Work Permit holders were tested even though they are
asymptomatic. Amongst them, 2 (Cases 42003 and 42100) had been
identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had already
been quarantined at government quarantine facilities. They were swabbed
during quarantine to verify their status. Another 3 cases (Cases 42098,
42112 and 42116) were tested as part of our efforts to screen workers in
essential services. The remaining 2 cases (Cases 42113 and 42114) were
detected through our proactive screening of persons working at
dormitories.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 8 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 252
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
