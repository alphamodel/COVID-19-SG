2.               Overall, the number of new cases in the community has
decreased from 4 cases in the week before, to 2 in the past week. The
number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at 2 cases

CASE DETAILS
A)    CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0

There are no cases in the community today.

B)    CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1

There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today, who was detected from our
bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories,
even though he is asymptomatic. This allows us to pick up cases early,
including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them
quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing,
tracing and isolating the close contacts.

C)    IMPORTED CASES: 2

Amongst the 2 imported cases, 1 (Case 58144) is a Student’s Pass holder
who arrived from France and the other (Case 58145) is a Dependant’s Pass
holder who arrived from the UAE. They had both been placed on SHN upon
arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.

3.               Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
4.               Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.               Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
Please refer to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.               21 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been
discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all,
57,879 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged
from hospitals or community care facilities.
7.               There are currently 43 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 23 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
