Updates On Border Measures and Community Surveillance Testing Operations



UPDATES ON BORDER MEASURES AND COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE TESTING OPERATIONS


Published Date: 26 Nov 2020

      The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the
global COVID-19 situation, and will be tightening border measures given
the increase in cases in Finland and Turkey. In addition, to ensure the
continued safe resumption of social and economic activities, the
Taskforce will extend its community surveillance testing operations to
more identified groups in the community.
TRAVELLERS FROM FINLAND AND TURKEY TO SERVE 14-DAY SHN AT DEDICATED SHN
FACILITIES
2.      As there has been a recent increase in cases reported by Finland
and Turkey, all travellers entering Singapore from 28 November 2020,
2359 hours, who have a travel history in the past 14 days to Finland and
Turkey will be required to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at
dedicated SHN facilities, even if they have obtained approval to opt-out
earlier.
3.       This is revised from our announcement on 27 October that
travellers from Finland and Turkey were allowed to serve their 14-day
SHN at a suitable place of residence.
4.      Travellers from Fiji, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand
are still allowed to apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and
serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the
following criteria:
a. Travelled to no other country/region than above-mentioned countries
[1], in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and
b. Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address)
alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN
with the same travel history and duration of SHN.
The COVID-19 tests will continue to be administered before the end of
the SHN.
5.      As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our
border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to
the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the
SafeTravel website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check
for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be
prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry,
including payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and
treatment.
COVID-19 TESTING FOR MORE IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY GROUPS
6.       The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been progressively conducting
testing operations for identified community groups, such as
stallholders, food delivery personnel and cashiers across the island.
These operations aim to provide a better picture of population
prevalence and facilitate the early containment of cryptic cases in the
community, especially as we continue to reopen our economy and allow
more activities to resume.
7.       More than 5,000 individuals have been tested at Marine Parade,
Ang Mo Kio and Taman Jurong since September 2020, and all who have
participated in these voluntary testing exercises have tested negative
for COVID-19. The results of the community testing operations indicate
very low prevalence rates in the community, and is an indicator that our
safe management measures are helping to keep our community safe.
8.       Even whilst community prevalence is low, we must not let our
guard down. Hence government agencies will be reaching out to other
identified community groups to offer COVID-19 testing on a one-time
basis. We are offering COVID-19 testing to stallholders in and around
Tekka Centre this week. In the coming weeks, we will also be offering
COVID-19 testing to individuals working at key delivery centres (e.g.
Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre) and key logistics delivery companies.
9.      We strongly encourage individuals in these identified community
groups to come forward and utilise the testing services offered. The
costs of these tests will be fully borne by the government.
ENABLING A SAFE REOPENING
10.    We will continue to review and calibrate our border measures to
enable a safe reopening of our borders, while facilitating the
resumption of key economic activities which are critical for
livelihoods. Testing remains a key enabler to safe reopening, and we
will continue to extend surveillance testing progressively to more
community groups across Singapore.
