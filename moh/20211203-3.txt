Strengthening Our Precautionary Measures Against the Omicron Variant



STRENGTHENING OUR PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES AGAINST THE OMICRON VARIANT


Published Date: 03 Dec 2021

Since the emergence of the Omicron variant of concern, the
Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has announced travel restrictions for
affected countries/regions1 and enhanced our testing regime for
travellers, including air travellers arriving via the Vaccinated Travel
Lane (VTL).
2. Since then, a growing number of countries/regions have reported
Omicron cases. Singapore is no exception. We have preliminarily detected
two imported COVID-19 cases with the Omicron variant. They are both
fully vaccinated, experiencing mild symptoms, and currently recovering
at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). The National
Public Health Laboratory is conducting whole genome sequencing to
confirm the Omicron variant. All other passengers who came into
Singapore on the same flight have tested negative for COVID-19 on
arrival and are quarantined under SHN at designated facilities. They
will undergo PCR tests at the end of their SHN.
3. We expect to see more Omicron cases being reported globally in the
weeks to come. We are coordinating with health authorities globally to
study and understand the Omicron variant. While we do so, we will
further augment our testing regime for travellers. Should the Omicron
variant be more transmissible than Delta and become the globally
dominant variant over time, it is a matter of time before it establishes
itself in Singapore. But the additional measures will help to buy time
to learn more about dealing with Omicron, and to continue with our
booster programme to strengthen our collective resilience for better
protection against this new variant.
UPDATE ON ASSESSMENT OF OMICRON VARIANT
4. As of 2 December 2021, the Omicron variant has been detected in at
least 28 other countries, mainly from persons with recent travel history
to southern Africa. There is currently no evidence to suggest that
symptoms associated with the Omicron variant are different or more
severe than those of other variants, or that current vaccines and
therapeutics would be ineffective against Omicron. More data and further
studies are needed to verify this.
5. We have also been closely monitoring studies on the sensitivity of
Antigen Rapid Tests (ARTs) to the Omicron variant. Preliminary
validation by the manufacturers show that ARTs remain effective in
detecting COVID-19 cases of the Omicron variant, and laboratories are
doing further biochemical tests to confirm these results. These initial
results lend confidence that ARTs remain effective as a method of
detecting COVID-19, including Omicron cases.
UPDATES TO BORDER MEASURES
Review of Country/Region Classifications
6. Due to the situation in BULGARIA, HUNGARY, ICELAND, IRELAND,
LUXEMBOURG, NORWAY AND POLAND, these countries will be placed in
Category III from 6 DECEMBER 2021, 2359 HOURS.
Expansion of Travel Restrictions to Additional Affected
Countries/Regions
7. To further step up our precautionary stance amidst growing
transmissions of Omicron globally, we will extend travel restrictions to
more countries which have seen a spike in Omicron cases. From 4 DECEMBER
2021, 2359 HOURS, all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors
with recent travel history to GHANA, MALAWI AND NIGERIA within the last
14 days will not be allowed to enter Singapore, or transfer/ transit
through Singapore. This restriction will apply to those who have
obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore. We will apply these
restrictions for four weeks in the first instance, after which we will
review and extend them if necessary.
Self-Administered ART for Travellers on Vaccinated Travel Lanes
8. Currently, all VTL travellers entering Singapore by air are to take
an On-Arrival PCR test, followed by supervised ART tests on Days 3 and
7. We will augment this testing regime with effect from 6 DECEMBER 2021,
2359 HOURS.
9. The enhanced ART protocol draws reference from the prevailing Health
Protocol 3 which is in place for all who are identified as close
contacts of an infected person.  Essentially, besides the Pre-Departure
and On-Arrival Tests, all travellers on VTL will be put on a daily
testing regime over 7 days using ART. The tests are all
self-administered, and travellers will be required to submit the results
of their self-administered ART online using a link which will be sent to
them via their declared contact details after arrival in Singapore.
However, on Days 3 and 7, the tests will have to be done under
supervision at a Combined Test Centre (CTC) or Quick Test Centre (QTC).²
Day 3 is the median incubation period, and Day 7 is the day of exit from
this testing protocol. During this 7-day period, other than on days when
they go out for their supervised tests, these travellers must test
negative on their self-administered ART before going out for activities
on that day.
10. The above 7-day enhanced ART protocols will also apply to travellers
arriving from Malaysia via VTL-Land from 6 DECEMBER 2021, 2359 HOURS.
The additional measures will further enhance the current testing
protocols for VTL-Land, which include a Pre-Departure Test and an
On-Arrival ART.
11. The testing regime for all VTL travellers from 6 DECEMBER 2021, 2359
HOURS³ is summarised in Table 1 below. This enhanced testing regime will
remain in place for four weeks in the first instance, i.e. until 2
January 2022, 2359 hours.

Regular Review of Border Measures
12. The full set of Safe Travel Lanes for travel to Singapore and
prevailing border measures under each lane for different categories will
be updated on the SafeTravel website. Not all lanes may utilise the
Category I/II/III/IV health measure framework. Travellers are advised to
visit the website to check the latest border measures for the associated
country or region before entering Singapore, and be prepared to be
subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry into Singapore.
13. All travellers are reminded to accurately declare their travel
history. Strict enforcement actions will be taken against false
declarations.
BEING PREPARED TO RESPOND NIMBLY TO OMICRON
14. Our tightened border measures will help to limit importation and
onward transmission of Omicron cases as we continue to study the
variant’s characteristics. However, given its high transmissibility and
spread to many parts of the world, we should expect to find more cases
at our borders and, in time to come, also within our community. We will
press on with our booster programme to best prepare our community for
any eventuality. We will monitor and evaluate data on the Omicron
variant as it emerges and need to remain nimble in our responses. We
seek Singaporeans’ understanding and support in the coming weeks as we
will need to introduce or change our measures at short notice, in
response to the fluid situation.
