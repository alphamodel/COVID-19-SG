The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to none in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All the new cases today are imported or linked to known cases/ clusters.<br><br><strong>Case Details<br><br>a)&nbsp; &nbsp; Cases in the community: 0</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>There are no cases in the community today.<br>&nbsp;<strong><br>b)&nbsp; &nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 3</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Amongst the 3 cases residing in dormitories, 2 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status, even though they are asymptomatic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The remaining case was detected through our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>c)&nbsp; &nbsp; Imported cases: 7<br>&nbsp;</strong><br>Amongst the 7 imported cases, 2 (Cases 58028 and 58029) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from Indonesia. Another 3 cases (Cases 58022, 58024 and 58025) are Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Malaysia and the Philippines. The remaining 2 cases (Cases 58023 and 58030) are Dependant\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from the Philippines and Saudi Arabia.<br>&nbsp;<br>They had all been placed on 14-day SHN upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving SHN even though all of them are asymptomatic.<br>&nbsp;<br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the clusters at Kranji Lodge I (12 Kranji Road) and Westlite Woodlands dormitory (2 Woodlands Sector 2) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
