    <body><h1>146 More Cases Discharged, 40 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 04 Sep 2020</p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 4 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 40 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>Summary of new cases</strong><br><br>Amongst the new cases today, 39 are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance, while 1 was symptomatic.&nbsp;<br><br><br><div dir="ltr" align="left"><br><div dir="ltr" align="left"><strong></strong><table class=""><colgroup><col width="241"><col width="120"><col width="120"><col width="120"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td class="" style="border-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><strong><br></strong></td><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Already in quarantine/ isolation before detection</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Detected from surveillance</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Total</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Imported cases</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr">3</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cases in the community</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cases residing in dormitories</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr">5</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">32</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">37</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br></div><br><strong>a) Imported cases: </strong>3 (1 Singaporean, 1 Permanent Resident, 1 Short-Term Visit Pass holder)<br><br>Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 57077) is a Singaporean and another (Case 57056 ) is a Permanent Resident who returned to Singapore from India on 28 August and 23 August. The remaining case (Case 57057) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from India on 26 August. He was allowed entry into Singapore as his spouse has been seeking medical treatment in Singapore. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Cases in the community: 0&nbsp;<br></strong><br>There are no cases in the community today.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>Cases residing in dormitories: 37</strong><br><br>Amongst the 37 cases residing in dormitories, 5 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 32 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections.<sup>1</sup> The serological test results for 16 cases have come back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-repor</a>t).

This is a precautionary measure following the detection of 3 cases (Cases 56184, 56626 and 56826) who had worked at or visited the shop, even though the risk of infection for visitors is assessed to be low. So far, a total of 250 individuals have been tested, and all the results have come back negative for COVID-19. MOH is facilitating testing for the remaining 4 individuals who have yet to be swabbed.<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong><br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 696 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>4 SEPTEMBER 2020<br></strong><hr><strong><br></strong><div><sup>1 </sup><span style="font-size: 11px;">Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective to others.</span><div><br></div></div></body>
