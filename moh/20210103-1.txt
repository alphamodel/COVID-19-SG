    is a cargo pilot who arrived from the US via Australia. He was
    isolated upon arrival in Singapore, and was conveyed directly to the
    National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) where he was tested
    and confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. His serological test
    result has come back positive.

They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or under isolation.

Case 58948 is a ship crew who had boarded a vessel on 4 March 2020 in
Indonesia. He developed a fever on 23 December but had self-medicated.
On 31 December, he was placed on quarantine as he had been identified as
a close contact of a previously reported case (Case 58812) who is a crew
member of the same vessel. Case 58948 failed to declare his symptoms
until 2 January 2021. He consulted a doctor via video-consultation on
the same day, and was subsequently conveyed to NCID where he tested
positive for COVID-19. Prior to that, he had not disembarked from the
vessel. All the remaining crew members of the vessel have been placed on
quarantine.

3.            Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
