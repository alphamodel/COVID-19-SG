There are no cases in the community today.

previous case.

Case 60513 is a 31 year-old male Bangladesh national who works as a

dormitory located at Kranji Way. His job entails loading and unloading
of goods, and he does not interact with clients.

He had been identified as a close contact of Case 60432[1] and was
placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 23 February. He was
tested for COVID-19 as part of our protocol to test individuals during
quarantine even though he is asymptomatic. His swab taken on 26 February
came back positive for COVID-19 and he was conveyed in an ambulance to
the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT
– the last being on 14 February – were negative for COVID-19 infection.
His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this
is likely a current infection.
