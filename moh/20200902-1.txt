A) IMPORTED CASES: 3 (1 Work Pass holder, 2 Work Permit holders)
Amongst the 3 imported cases, 2 (Cases 56959 and 56962) are Work Pass/
Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from
India and the Philippines on 21 August. Both of them had been placed on
14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been
tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.
The remaining case (Case 56971) is a seaman who had been tested upon
arrival from Indonesia on 26 August. He had been isolated while awaiting
his test result, and was subsequently conveyed in an ambulance to a
hospital when it came back positive.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Pass holder, 1 Work
Permit holder)
All 3 cases in the community were picked up as a result of our proactive
surveillance and screening. 2 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were
detected through our proactive testing.
All 3 cases in the community are currently unlinked. Amongst them, 2
(Cases 56944 and 56946) were detected as a result of our Rostered
Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process
sectors who are living outside the dormitories. The remaining case (Case
56960) was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to
identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further
spread.
Epidemiological investigations of the cases are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to
determine if they could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 43
Amongst the 43 cases residing in dormitories, 14 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 29 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with ARI symptoms. This allows us to
pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to
ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively
containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections.  The serological test results for 23 cases have come
back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     Of the new cases, 82% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     142 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 55,891 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.     There are currently 75 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 867 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
