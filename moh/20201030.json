Case 58176 is asymptomatic and was detected when he underwent a pre-departure COVID-19 test on 27 October prior to a planned trip to India which came back positive. He had been in India in July and August 2020, and had served 14-day SHN at a dedicated facility when he returned to Singapore on 28 August. He was tested negative for COVID-19 while serving SHN. His serological test taken on 29 October is positive, and epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine if this could be a past infection.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 1<br></strong><strong></strong><strong><br></strong>There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today.

In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 700; font-size: 13px;\">5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
