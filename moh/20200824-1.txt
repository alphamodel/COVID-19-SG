Published Date: 24 Aug 2020

1. As of 24 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 51 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
SUMMARY OF NEW CASES

A) IMPORTED CASES: 7 (1 Permanent Resident, 2 Work Permit holders, 3
Dependant’s Pass holders, 1 Long-Term Visit Pass holder)
Amongst the 7 imported cases, 1 (Case 56467) is a Singapore Permanent
Resident who returned to Singapore from India on 12 August. 4 (Cases
56448, 56453, 56454 and 56456) are Dependant’s Pass and Long-Term Pass
holders who arrived from India and the Netherlands on 9 August and 10
August. Another 2 (Cases 56465 and 56468) are Work Permit holders
currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India and Indonesia on
12 August.
All the cases had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated
facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Singaporean)
There is 1 case in the community today (Case 56466) who had been
identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case. She had been
placed on quarantine earlier, and was tested during quarantine to
determine her status.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 43
Amongst the 43 cases residing in dormitories, 26 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 17 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with acute respiratory infection (ARI)
symptoms. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic
ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections.¹ The serological test results for 11 cases have come
back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.
2. Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex A for
the summary of the confirmed cases.
3. Of the new cases, 88% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
4. MOH has completed our screening and testing of all individuals who
had visited Jewel Music Box KTV at HomeTeamNS Khatib on 1 August and 2
August. The KTV was not operational during the visits and there were no
singing activities held. This is a precautionary measure following the
detection of 3 cases (Cases 55169, 55469 and 55712) who had visited the
KTV during the affected dates, even though the risk of infection for
visitors is assessed to be low. In all, 322 individuals were tested, and
all the results have come back negative.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6. 423 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 54,587 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7. There are currently 84 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of
these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care
unit. 1,706 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
