        As of 4 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 295 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 7 (2 Permanent Residents, 2 Work Pass holders, 2
Dependant’s Pass holders, 1 Student’s Pass holder)
Amongst the 7 imported cases, 2 (Cases 53405 and 53406) are Singapore
Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India on 23 July. The
remaining cases also arrived recently from India. 2 (Cases 53327 and
53404) are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in Singapore,
and had arrived in Singapore on 22 July and 31 July. Another 2 (Cases
53256 and 53326) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived on 21 July and
22 July, and the remaining case (Case 53407) is a Student’s Pass holder
who arrived on 23 July.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated
facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Permit holder)
Of the 2 cases in the community, 1 was picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine. Both cases are asymptomatic, and were detected through our
proactive testing.
1 community case today is linked to a previous case. Case 53403 had been
identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and was tested
during quarantine to determine his status, even though he is
asymptomatic.
1 community case is currently unlinked. Case 53408 was identified from
our proactive screening of workers in essential services who are living
outside the dormitories, even though she is asymptomatic.
Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 286
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.     The Inter-Agency Task Force has been systematically and
progressively clearing dormitories through aggressive testing of migrant
workers residing in dormitories. The following dormitories have been
cleared, and now house only recovered individuals and those who have
recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As such, the clusters
have now been closed.
