The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 4 </strong>(3 Work Pass holders, 1 Work Permit holder)<br><br>Amongst the 4 imported cases, 3 (Cases 51725, 51829 and 51830) are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in Singapore, and had arrived from India between 15 July and 18 July. The remaining case (Case 51889) is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Indonesia on 18 July. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 4 </strong>(1 Singaporean, 3 Work Permit holders)<br><br>All 4 cases in the community today are linked to the cluster at Bukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub. They are asymptomatic, and were detected as part of our proactive case finding of individuals working at a newly emergent workplace cluster. To determine if these cases are current or past infections, we also conducted serological tests for them, and the results for all 4 cases have come back positive, which indicate likely past infections . As a precautionary measure, MOH is working with the Land Transport Authority to arrange for close contacts of these cases to be tested. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 270</strong><br><br>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will be easing restrictions on two key life events \u2013 namely weddings and wakes/ funerals \u2013 as part of a careful, calibrated resumption of activities in Phase Two. <br><br>2. Singapore is six weeks into Phase Two of re-opening. Since Phase Two, most activities have resumed, subject to strict safe management measures being put in place. The number of community cases has remained low with the continued vigilance of businesses and the public over the past few weeks. However the likelihood of a second wave remains if we let down our guard.&nbsp; <br><br>3. Thus far, we have taken a cautious approach for activities or settings where large numbers of persons are likely to come into close contact, often in enclosed spaces, and for prolonged periods of time. Nevertheless, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce recognises the need for particularly important activities and key life events to continue during this period. We have therefore reviewed our measures to see how these can be carried out safely. <br><br><strong>Marriage Solemnisations and Receptions </strong><br><br>4. Since the beginning of Phase Two, marriage solemnizations have been allowed to take place with up to 20 persons (excluding the Solemniser), subject to the venue\u2019s capacity limit based on safe management principles. From 4 August 2020, this will be <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">expanded to 50 persons</span> (including the couple, excluding the Solemniser and vendors) for the entire event, subject to the venue\u2019s capacity limit based on safe management principles. This will apply to venues such as places of worship, HDB common areas and other external venues. Solemnisations at home, the Registry of Civil and Muslim Marriages (ROM/M) Building, and designated areas at the National Museum of Singapore operated by ROM will continue to take place with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">up to 10 persons</span> (including the couple, excluding the Solemniser and vendors), as these venues tend to be smaller. <br><br>5. In addition, we will launch a pilot where each wedding couple will also be allowed to hold <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">one </span></strong>wedding reception (including food and drinks), with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">up to 50 attendees (including the couple) for the entire duration of the event</span>, in venues that are permitted to serve food and drinks (e.g. restaurants, hotels), and subject to their capacity limit based on safe management principles. Prevailing safe management measures must also be strictly adhered to. <br><br>6. All other wedding-related activities including customary rites and ceremonies, would have to adhere to prevailing gathering size limits e.g. up to 5 visitors to each household, or up to 5 persons in a group outside the home. <br><br>7. Venue operators and owners (e.g. restaurants, hotels) holding these events must ensure that the physical set-up and event arrangements are in accordance with the above groupings and other safe management measures. Please refer to <a title=\"Annex A\" href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-a-(wsmm).pdf?sfvrsn=1e4f910f_0\">Annex A</a>&nbsp;for the types of venues where marriage solemnizations and receptions may be held, and <a href=\"https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector\">https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector</a> for the full set of safe management measures which will need to be put in place (a summary of key measures can be found in <a title=\"Annex B\" href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-b-(wsmm).pdf?sfvrsn=34fcb980_0\">Annex B</a>). <br><br>8. Through this pilot, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will assess the ability of the organisers and venue owners to ensure that the necessary safe management measures are put in place and adhered to. This will then inform the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on subsequent reviews of the parameters for such events. As these receptions remain of higher risk, we seek couples\u2019 understanding and compliance with these guidelines, to keep their family members and friends safe, so that all present can look back on the event with happy memories. We also seek Singaporeans\u2019 understanding that there is still a need to limit our total risk exposure so that we can keep community transmission low while resuming key activities. <br><strong><br>Wakes and Funerals </strong><br><br>9. Since the beginning of Phase Two, for wakes and funerals, up to 20 persons may be present at any one time. We recognise that this is a particularly emotionally difficult period for the families involved. To facilitate more family members and friends to pay their last respects, from 4 August 2020, up to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">30 persons may be present at any one time</span>, subject to the venue\u2019s capacity limit based on safe management principles. We will continue to review the group size limits and safe management measures as part of the gradual re-opening. <br><strong><br>Changing Norms in the New COVID-19 Normal </strong><br><br>10. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to monitor the situation closely, with the aim of continuing to enable key social and economic activities to resume gradually and safely. Meanwhile, we must all adjust our expectations, lifestyles and norms, as we are not going back to the way things were before COVID-19. Individuals are encouraged to experiment with innovative approaches for the commemoration of key life events in the new normal, such as having hybrid virtual-physical events, so that we can continue to protect our family and loved ones as much as possible. <br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH <br>30 JULY 2020</strong>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "easing-restrictions-on-key-life-events", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "278 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1596094500000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "30 Jul 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 30 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 278 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories.
