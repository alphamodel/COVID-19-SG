COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE TESTING AT SIMS AVENUE


Published Date: 22 Jul 2021

      The Ministry of Health (MOH) is investigating likely COVID-19
transmission at 842, 844, 846 and 848 Sims Avenue, which are located
near Geylang Serai Market. COVID-19 viral fragments have been detected
in wastewater samples collected from the blocks. Epidemiological
investigations are ongoing to determine linkages and the source of
transmission.
2. In order to quickly uncover community infection cases,
MOH will conduct mandatory COVID-19 testing for all residents at 842,
844, 846 and 848 Sims Avenue; as well as owners and staff of commercial
units at the same blocks. Testing is optional for those who have tested
negative for COVID-19 infection from 17 July onwards. Mandatory testing
will be conducted at the pavilion at 3 Geylang Serai from 22 July to 23
July 2021 between 9am and 4pm. In the event that a
positive COVID-19 case is detected, MOH will isolate the case, identify
all close contacts, test and quarantine them to protect the community
from further transmission.
3. To detect possible asymptomatic cases in the community, MOH
will also conduct voluntary COVID-19 testing for visitors and those who
have interacted with residents at 842, 844, 846 and 848 Sims
Avenuebetween 6 July and 20 July 2021. We encourage these individuals to
come forward for testing. Testing will be conducted by appointment only
at designated Regional Screening Centres from 22 July to 24 July 2021
and at the pavilion at 3 Geylang Serai from 23 July to 24 July
2021, between 9am and 4pm. To book an appointment and for information on
the alternate test locations, please

any queries.
4. All residents are to bring along their NRIC for
identification purposes. Leaflets have been distributed and SMS
notifications have been sent to the residents to provide them with more
information. Residents are reminded to keep to their appointment time.
Residents are also advised to monitor their health closely and consult a
doctor immediately if they feel unwell. Those who are still awaiting
their test results are advised to minimise social interactions as much
as possible. They should continue to monitor their health and seek
immediate medical attention if they feel unwell.
