CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3
There are 3 cases in the community today, all of whom are currently
unlinked.
CURRENTLY UNLINKED CASE
Detected through surveillance:
Case 64135 is a 57 year-old female Singaporean who works as a promoter
at Guardian (ION Orchard). She developed a dry throat on 7 June, but did
not seek medical attention. She subsequently developed an ear ache on 10
June and sought treatment at a polyclinic, where she underwent both an
antigen rapid test (ART) and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.
Both results came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 10 June. Her
serology test result is negative.
Case 64139 is a 50 year-old female Singaporean who is employed by
Campaign Complete Solutions Pte Ltd as a janitor at Raffles City Tower
and One Raffles Quay. She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she was
tested for COVID-19 on 10 June as part of surveillance testing for mall
cleaners. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on
the same day. Her serology test result is negative for the N antigen,
which suggests the presence of early infection. Case 64139 received her
first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 1 May, and the second dose on 29 May.
Case 64149 is a 38 year-old male Indonesia national who is employed by
Marina Offshore Pte Ltd as a sea crew on board tugboat MARINA ARIEL. He
developed a fever on 7 June but did not seek medical attention. He then
developed a loss of smell and taste on 9 June, and subsequently a
headache and chills on 10 June. He reported his symptoms on 10 June, and
was conveyed to a hospital and tested for COVID-19. Prior to that, he
had not disembarked from the vessel. His test result came back positive
for COVID-19 infection on 11 June. His serology test result is pending.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 6
Amongst the 6 imported cases,
• 3 (Cases 64136, 64150 and 64151) are Singaporeans and 2 (Cases 64137
and 64152) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India and
the US.

4. Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5. Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
Closure of ION Orchard from 12 June
6. MOH is investigating 3 cases (Cases 64112, 64114 and 64135) of
COVID-19 infection amongst individuals who work in ION Orchard. To break
any potential chain of transmission and enable deep cleaning of the
premises, ION Orchard will be closed to all members of the public
starting from 12 June 2021 and re-open 4 days later, on 16 June 2021.
7. In order to disrupt any wider, undetected community transmission, we
will conduct special testing operations for staff who have been working
in ION Orchard shopping mall from 28 May. We will also extend free
COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited the retail
shops or used the services/ facilities at ION Orchard between 3 June to
11 June. Individuals who had only walked through the mall to connect to
neighbouring buildings or Orchard MRT station need not be tested. Please
refer to http://go.gov.sg/ion-testing for details on the testing
operations.
8. All visitors to ION Orchard between 3 June and 11 June are advised to
monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as
possible, for 14 days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to
see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
9. 34 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 61,799 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or

10. There are currently 133 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 279 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 34 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
