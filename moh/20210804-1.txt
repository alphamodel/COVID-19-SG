vaccinated. Of these, 6 require oxygen supplementation while 2 require
ICU care as they have underlying medical conditions. 37 seniors above 60

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES
8.    Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased
from 915 cases in the week before to 758 cases in the past week. We are
likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as we
step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the community.
The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased from 202
cases in the week before to 235 cases in the past week. The 7-day moving
average number of all linked community cases and all unlinked community
cases are 74.7 and 33.6 respectively.

CLOSURE OF YUHUA HAWKER CENTRE
11.     MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
markets and food centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who
visited Jurong Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the
markets and food centres. We have detected 7 cases amongst individuals
who worked in or visited Yuhua Hawker Centre (347 Jurong East Avenue 1),
and our epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely
ongoing transmission at the hawker centre. To break the chain of
transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, Yuhua Hawker
Centre will be closed to all members of the public from 5 August to 19
August 2021. All individuals who work in the hawker centre have been
placed on quarantine, and will be tested during quarantine.
12.     To quickly uncover any community infection cases, we will also
extend free COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited
Yuhua Market and Hawker Centre between 21 July and 4 August. Please
refer to https://go.gov.sg/yuhua-testing for details on the testing
operations.
13.     All visitors to Yuhua Market and Hawker Centre are advised to
monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as
possible, for 14 days from their date of visit or interaction. They are
encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.
14.     Please refer to MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
