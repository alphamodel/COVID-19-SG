He is making good progress and can perform his activities of daily living without assistance. He will likely be discharged in the coming weeks, but will likely require outpatient rehabilitation for some time before he can return to school and resume other activities. The medical team will continue his treatment and monitor his condition.</span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Medical investigations have found that the youth had developed acute severe myocarditis which led to the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The myocarditis was likely a serious adverse event arising from the COVID-19 vaccine he received, which might have been aggravated by his strenuous lifting of weights and his high consumption of caffeine through energy drinks and supplements.</span></span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP) provided by the Ministry of Health (MOH), a one-time financial assistance of $225,000 has been extended to the youth and his family. The independent clinical panel appointed to assess and adjudicate the VIFAP application found that while he has made good improvement, because his condition was severe and critical, he will require treatment and rehabilitation for some time yet to continue his recovery.</span></span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Continue to avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after each dose</span></span></span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While there is a small increased risk of myocarditis or pericarditis following the administration of the vaccines, the local incidence rate remains low at 0.48 per 100,000 doses administered, based on ongoing pharmacovigilance monitoring by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA).
