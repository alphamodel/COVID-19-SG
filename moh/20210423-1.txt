from 4 cases in the week before to 10 cases in the past week. The number

monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

April, 65 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 73 have
tested negative, and 36 serology test results are pending.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2
There are 2 cases in the community today who are currently unlinked.
_Case 62285_
Case 62285 is a 33 year-old male Indonesia national who is a sea crew on
board a bunker tanker. He arrived by flight from Indonesia on 4 February
and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 18 February. His on-arrival
test on 4 February was negative for COVID-19, as was his test taken
during SHN on 17 February. He boarded a vessel on 18 February, and had
not disembarked except to go for COVID-19 vaccination.
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested onboard on 20
April as part of our protocol to test sea crew. His test result came
back positive for COVID-19 the next day, and he was conveyed in an
ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His
serology test result has come back positive.
Case 62285 received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccination on 16 April.
As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been
infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just
before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for
an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.
_Case 62294 _
Case 62294, a 38 year-old male Indonesia national, is a Short-Term Visit
Pass holder who is in Singapore for a work project. He arrived from
Indonesia on 28 March and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 11
April. His on-arrival test, as well as swab taken during SHN on 10
April, were negative for COVID-19.
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 22 April in preparation for his trip back to
Indonesia. His test result came back positive on the same day, and he
was conveyed in an ambulance to Mount Elizabeth Hospital. His serology
test result has come back positive. He received his first dose of
COVID-19 vaccine on 4 March, and the second dose on 18 March in
Indonesia.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today who is currently
unlinked.
Case 62273, a 21 year-old male India national, is a Work Permit holder
who arrived in Singapore in October 2018. He is employed by Sembcorp
Marine Integrated Yard Pte Ltd and works at Sembcorp Marine Tuas
Boulevard Yard. He resides at SCM Tuas Lodge (80 Tuas South Boulevard).
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 19 April as
part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back
positive for COVID-19, and he was immediately isolated. An individual
test was done on 20 April, and his test result came back positive for
COVID-19 infection the next day. He was subsequently conveyed to NCID in
an ambulance. His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 12 April –
were all negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has
come back positive.
Case 62273 received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 11 March, and
the second dose on 1 April. This likely accounts for his lack of
symptoms and positive serology test result. The COVID-19 vaccine is
effective in preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of
those vaccinated, but it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get
infected. Further research is required to determine if the vaccination
will also prevent onward transmission of the infection. Our existing key
enablers – safe management measures, testing, and contact tracing –
continue to be necessary and effective in helping us to mitigate spread
and keep community transmission low.

(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.     Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     10 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,613 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 80 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 220 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
