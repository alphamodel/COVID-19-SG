+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

A)    IMPORTED CASES: 10 (2 Singaporeans, 5 Permanent Residents, 2 Work
Pass holders, 1 Short-Term Visit Pass holder)

Amongst the 10 imported cases, 2 (Cases 57473 and 57474) are
Singaporeans and 5 (Cases 57475, 57476, 57477, 57481 and 57482) are
Singapore Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India on 30
August and 31 August. Another 2 (Cases 57462 and 57489) are Work Pass
holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Germany on 30
August and the Philippines on 29 August. The remaining case (Case
57468), a Short-Term Visit Pass holder, is the spouse of a Singaporean
who arrived from India on 5 September.

All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.

B)    CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 4 (1 Permanent Resident, 1 Work Pass
holder, 2 Work Permit holders)

Of the 4 cases in the community, 3 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. All 4 cases are asymptomatic, and were detected
through our proactive testing.
All cases in the community today are linked to previous cases or
clusters. Case 57470 had been identified as a contact of a previously
confirmed case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. He was tested
during quarantine to determine his status, even though he is
asymptomatic. Case 57463 was tested as part of our efforts to screen
individuals working in frontline COVID-19 operations, and Case 57461 was
swabbed as part of our active case finding efforts. The remaining case
(Case 57495) was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of
workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living
outside the dormitories.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

C)    CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 28

Amongst the 28 cases residing in dormitories, 16 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.

The remaining 12 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past
infections.[1] The serological test result for 1 case has come back
positive so far, which indicates a likely past infection.

2.               Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.               Of the new cases, 88% are imported or linked to known
cases/ clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.


LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.               Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
Please refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.               92 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been
discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all,
56,699 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged
from hospitals or community care facilities.
6.               There are currently 54 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 577 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.


MINISTRY OF HEALTH
12 SEPTEMBER 2020
[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
