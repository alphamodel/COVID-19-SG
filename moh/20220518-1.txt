Launch of Healthier Sg Public Consultation



LAUNCH OF HEALTHIER SG PUBLIC CONSULTATION


Published Date: 18 May 2022

        The Ministry of Health (MOH) will embark on a public
consultation from 18 May to 15 August 2022 as part of efforts to involve
Singaporeans in shaping the Healthier SG strategy. We invite the public
to share their views and suggestions on Healthier SG through an online
survey or a series of group engagement sessions. The feedback gathered
will be studied and incorporated into a White Paper, which will be
tabled in Parliament for debate later this year.
2.      Interested participants can take part in the online survey or
register for the engagement sessions on the Healthier SG website at
www.healthiersg.gov.sg. Those who have registered for the engagement
sessions will receive a confirmation of their participation via an email
from MOH.
3.      A total of five engagement sessions will be held over the next
month starting from 26 May 2022. Those who are unable to attend the
in-person sessions and prefer the convenience of online engagement can
provide their views through the online survey. Details of the engagement
sessions are below.

~~4.    Announced at MOH’s Committee of Supply Debate 2022, Healthier SG
will help all Singaporeans take steps towards better health. We have
built a good healthcare system in Singapore, but we need to focus on
better health and quality of life for everyone. The core elements of
Healthier SG are:
i) National Healthier SG Enrolment Programme: Each resident can choose
which primary care clinic they wish to enrol to and will be empowered
and guided by a family physician to take next steps for better health.

ii) One Singaporean, One Family Physician: We want to enable a trusted
lifelong relationship between each Singaporean and their family
physician.

iii)  Accessible and Supportive Care Plans: Seeing a family physician
for preventive care is different from occasional acute visits. These
regular check-ins will focus on discussing next steps based on an
individual’s needs and preferences.

iv)  Integrated Health Ecosystem with Clusters and Community Partners:
The healthcare clusters will work towards developing an integrated
health ecosystem within each region, with community partners
contributing to support for residents’ needs and addressing the
influence of social and environmental determinants on their health.

v)  Support Structures: We will work with key stakeholders to ensure
that our support structures which include healthcare financing,
manpower, data flows, as well as key monitoring indicators, support
Healthier SG.

For more information on Healthier SG, please visit
www.healthiersg.gov.sg or refer to Annex A.

5.    Prior to the start of these public consultations, we have been
engaging General Practitioners and the senior management of our
healthcare clusters to hear their views, understand their concerns and
co-create solutions. We have also conducted more than 100 in-depth
one-on-one interviews with residents to understand how different
circumstances and experiences may influence their views on Healthier SG.

6.    MOH will continue to engage key healthcare stakeholders including
primary care practitioners, insurers and other healthcare professionals
over the next few months. We welcome the public and healthcare
stakeholders to share their views on Healthier SG with us so that
together we can work towards a healthier Singapore population.
