4. All residents are to bring along their NRIC for
identification purposes. Leaflets have been distributed and SMS
notifications have been sent to the residents to provide them with more
information. Residents are reminded to keep to their appointment time.
Residents are also advised to monitor their health closely and consult a
doctor immediately if they feel unwell. Those who are still awaiting
their test results are advised to minimise social interactions as much
as possible. They should continue to monitor their health and seek
immediate medical attention if they feel unwell.
