CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
58425 is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who was allowed entry into
Singapore to visit his family members who are Singaporeans. He is
asymptomatic, and was detected when he went for a COVID-19 pre-departure
test on 28 November before a scheduled trip to the US.
He was conveyed to the hospital when his test came back positive for
COVID-19 infection on 29 November. His serological test result is also
positive, which indicates likely past infection.
He had arrived in Singapore from Nepal on 1 November, and was placed on
14-day SHN at a dedicated facility upon arrival in Singapore from 1
November to 15 November. He was tested negative for COVID-19 infection
on 11 November while serving SHN. He subsequently stayed at a friend’s
flat at Bishan Street 22, and visited his family staying at Yishun
Avenue 6.
Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case have been isolated and placed on
quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine
period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct
serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could
have been infected by them.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 4
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 1 (Case 58426) is a Singaporean who
returned to Singapore from Japan. The remaining 3 cases (Cases 58427,
58428 and 58429) are Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore
who arrived from Indonesia and India. They had all already been placed
on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.
3.     Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4.     The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been progressively conducting
community surveillance testing for identified community groups, such as
stallholders, food delivery personnel and cashiers across the island.
These enable us to contain cryptic cases in the community early, and
prevent further transmission. We conducted community testing operations
on 27 November and 28 November for individuals working at Pasir Panjang
Wholesale Centre. In all, 1,068 individuals were tested, and all the
results have come back negative.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     10 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,134 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.     There are currently 29 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 26 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
