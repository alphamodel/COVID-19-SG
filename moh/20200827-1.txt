A)      IMPORTED CASES: 5 (2 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1
Dependant’s Pass holder, 1 Long-Term Visit Pass holder, 1 Special Pass
holder)
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 2 (Cases 56594 and 56595) are
Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India
on 14 August and 15 August. Another 2 (Cases 56642 and 56649) are
Dependant’s Pass and Long-Term Pass holders who arrived from India on 15
August and China on 16 August. All of them had been placed on 14-day
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested
while serving their SHN.
The remaining case (Case 56621) is a seaman who is a Special Pass
holder. He arrived in Singapore from India on 8 August on a vessel,
where he had not disembarked from. As he had been identified as a close
contact of previous cases on the same vessel earlier announced by MOH,
he had been placed on quarantine and was tested during quarantine to
determine his status.
B)     CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (2 SINGAPOREANS)
Both cases in the community were detected under our enhanced community
testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with
acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor.
This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly
contain further spread.
1 of the cases today is linked to a previous case. Epidemiological
investigations found that Case 56626 had visited SLR Revolution at
Excelsior Shopping Centre (5 Coleman Street) on 17 August 2020 and may
have had contact with Case 56184, who had gone to work at the shop
during his infectious period. The risk of infection for visitors is
assessed to be low. However as a precautionary measure, MOH will be
contacting all individuals who had visited the shop between 15 August
and 18 August, and facilitating COVID-19 testing for them. Those who are
unwell when contacted will be conveyed to the hospital for further
medical assessment. We advise all visitors to SLR Revolution at
Excelsior Shopping Centre during the affected dates to monitor their
health and seek medical attention promptly should they develop acute
respiratory infection symptoms. They may call MOH at 1800-333-9999 if
they have queries.
The other community case (Case 56627) is currently unlinked.
Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for his household contacts to
determine if he could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day
in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
C)     CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 70
Amongst the 70 cases residing in dormitories, 66 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 4 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with ARI symptoms. This allows us to
pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to
ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively
containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections. [1] The serological test results for 8 cases have come
back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 97% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
4.      The following dormitories have been cleared by the Inter-agency
Taskforce, and now house only recovered individuals and those who have
recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As such, the clusters
have now been closed.

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
