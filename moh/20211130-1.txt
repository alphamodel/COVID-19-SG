Update On Local Covid-19 Situation



UPDATE ON LOCAL COVID-19 SITUATION


Published Date: 30 Nov 2021

Summary of local situation

• 1,113 cases remain warded in hospital. 216 cases require oxygen
supplementation in the general ward, 13 are unstable and under close
monitoring in the intensive care unit (ICU), and 65 are critically ill
and intubated in the ICU. The current overall ICU utilisation rate is
58.5%.

• Over the last 28 days, of the 60,166 infected individuals, 98.7% had
no or mild symptoms, 0.9% required oxygen supplementation in the general
ward, 0.2% were in the ICU, and 0.2% has died.

• MOH has completed a periodic update of our population numbers. Our
population has decreased slightly, as individuals who have passed on or
returned to their home countries outnumbered new-borns and inflows. We
have therefore adjusted our vaccinated coverage accordingly. As of 29
November 2021, the total number of individuals who have completed their
full regimen/ received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines is 96% (adjusted
from 94%) of the eligible population, and 86% (adjusted from 85%) of the
total population.  As a percentage of total population, 87% has received
at least one dose, and 26% has received their booster shots.

• Over the past day, 1,399 cases were discharged, of whom 276 are
seniors aged 60 years and above. 1,239 new cases of COVID-19 infection
were detected, with 1,193 in the community, 24 in the migrant worker
dormitories and 22 imported cases. The weekly infection growth rate is
0.66.


SITUATION AT HOSPITALS

1.     As of 30 November 2021, 216 cases require oxygen supplementation
in the general ward, 13 are unstable and under close monitoring in the
ICU to prevent further deterioration, and 65 are critically ill and
intubated in the ICU. The current overall ICU utilisation rate is 58.5%.

STATUS OF PATIENTS

2.     Over the last 28 days, 98.7% of local infected cases were
asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, 0.9% required oxygen supplementation
in the general ward, 0.1% were unstable and under close monitoring in
the ICU to prevent further deterioration, and 0.1% had been critically
ill and intubated in the ICU.

3.     Seniors 60 years old and above, especially if unvaccinated,
continue to be more adversely affected by COVID-19:

VACCINATION

4.     MOH has completed a periodic update of our population
numbers. Our population has decreased slightly, as individuals who have
passed on or returned to their home countries outnumbered new-borns and
inflows. We have therefore adjusted our vaccinated coverage
accordingly. As of 29 November 2021, the total number of individuals who
have completed their full regimen/ received two doses of COVID-19
vaccines is 96% (adjusted from 94%) of the eligible population, and 86%
(adjusted from 85%) of the total population.  As a percentage of total
population, 87% has received at least one dose, and 26% has received
their booster shots.

5.     MOH has also been paying special attention to the number of
unvaccinated seniors aged 60 years and above, who are the most
vulnerable if infected with COVID-19. With the adjustment of our
population base, the number of unvaccinated seniors aged 60 years and
above has dropped from 57,769 to 43,611. This is because the estimated
total number of persons in that age group has been reduced. After
subtracting the number who has been fully vaccinated, the remainder is a
significantly smaller number than the previous estimate.

6.     Over the past 7 days, the number of fully vaccinated and
non-fully vaccinated cases who are critically ill in the ICU are at 0.5
and 4.3 per 100,000 population respectively. Over the same period, the
number of fully vaccinated and non-fully vaccinated cases who died are
0.1 and 0.4 per 100,000 population respectively. Among seniors aged 60
and above, the number of fully vaccinated and non-fully vaccinated cases
who are critically ill in the ICU are 1.8 and 39.5 respectively. The
number of fully vaccinated and non-fully vaccinated seniors who died are
0.2 and 4.5 respectively.

INFLOW AND OUTFLOW OF CASES

7.     Over the past day, 1,399 cases were discharged, of whom 276 are
seniors aged 60 years and above.

community cases, 24 dormitory resident cases and 22 imported cases.
Amongst the community cases today are 179 seniors who are aged 60 years
and above. The ratio of community cases for the past week over the week
before is 0.66.

9.     8 more cases, aged between 47 and 87 years, have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection. All of them had various
underlying medical conditions.

cases’ worst-ever condition; deceased cases previously in ICU are
counted under ‘Deceased’ and not under ‘Ever Critically ill and
Intubated in ICU’.

includes those who have passed on earlier, but whose cause of death was
investigated and confirmed only later, e.g. Coroner’s cases.

and completely unvaccinated.
