these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance
programme.

February, 114 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 34

CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 59980 is a 56 year-old male Singaporean who works as an import
officer at Yusen Logistics and is based at Changi Cargo Megaplex 1 (119
Airport Cargo Road). His job does not entail interaction with flight
passengers.
He developed a cough on 2 February but did not seek medical attention
and continued to go to work. As he had been identified earlier as a
contact of a tuberculosis (TB) case at his workplace, he went to the
Tuberculosis Control Unit on 4 February for TB screening. There, he was
tested for COVID-19 after he reported his symptoms.
His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same
day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. His earlier test from a testing operation of
airport cargo workers on 18 January had been negative for COVID-19
infection. His serological test result has come back negative,
indicating that this is likely a current infection.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today.
Case 59966, a 31 year-old male Bangladesh national, is a Work Pass
holder who arrived in Singapore on 13 December 2020, and served SHN at a
dedicated facility until 27 December. His swab done on 23 December
during SHN was negative for COVID-19.
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when his test taken on 4 February
as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) came back positive for
COVID-19 infection. His earlier test from RRT on 13 January was negative
for COVID-19. His serology test has come back positive, but given the
relatively long time interval between his travel and positive COVID-19
test, we have classified this case as locally transmitted.
He has not started work since arriving in Singapore, and stays at a
dormitory located at 1 Soon Lee Street.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 23
Amongst the 23 imported cases,
• 3 (Cases 59968, 59969 and 59988) are Singaporeans and 2 (Cases 59981
and 59991) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from Canada,
India, Iran and the UAE.
• 2 (Cases 59970 and 59977) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived
from India and the UAE.
• 4 (Cases 59967, 59990, 59993 and 59994) are Work Pass holders who
arrived from India, Russia and the UAE.
• 11 (Cases 59971, 59974, 59975, 59976, 59982, 59983, 59984, 59986,
59987, 59989 and 59992) are Work Permit holders who arrived from
Indonesia and Myanmar, all of whom are foreign domestic workers.
• 1 (Case 59973) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from the
Netherlands for a work project in Singapore.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
4.     Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family and
household members, as well as co-workers, have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
case could have been infected by them.
5.    Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.      25 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,373 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.      There are currently 41 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 206 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
