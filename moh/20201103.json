Both were detected through our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 7<br></strong><br>Amongst the 7 imported cases, 1 is a Singaporean (Case 58203) and another is a Singapore Permanent Resident (Case 58202) who returned from the Philippines and India respectively. Another case (Case 58205) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from Bangladesh. Another 3 cases are currently employed in Singapore. Of these, Cases 58204 and 58206 are Work Pass holders who arrived from the UAE and Germany, and Case 58207 is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Bangladesh. The remaining case (Case 58201) is a Special Pass holder who arrived from the Philippines to board a ship docked here as a crew member.<br><br>They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
