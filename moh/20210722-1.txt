_Closure of Boon Lay Place Food Village_
7.     MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
markets and food centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who
visited Jurong Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the
markets and food centres. We have detected 7 cases amongst individuals
who worked in or visited Boon Lay Place Food Village. To break the chain
of transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, Boon Lay Place
Food Village (221B Boon Lay Place) will be closed to all members of the
public from 23 July to 6 August 2021.
_Community surveillance testing for visitors to selected markets & food
centres_
8.     To uncover any community infection cases, we will extend free
COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited Boon Lay Place
Food Village and  Chong Pang Market & Food Centre between 8 July and 22
July. Please refer to https://go.gov.sg/mkt-testing for details on the
testing operations.
CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
9.     415 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 7 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 1 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU). None amongst these 8 cases is fully
vaccinated.

serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 7 local

away. 6 are unvaccinated, 1 is partially vaccinated and none was fully
vaccinated.
