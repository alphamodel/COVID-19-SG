CASE DETAILS

A)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1

There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.

Case 61768, a 71 year-old female Indian national, is a Short-Term Visit
Pass holder who is a retiree. She arrived from India on 28 December 2020
and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 10 January 2021. Her test
taken on 8 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19. As she had been
identified as a close contact of Cases 59169 and 59173 during their
flight to Singapore, she was placed on quarantine from 10 January to 11
January.

She developed a fever on 5 April and was tested for COVID-19 when she
sought medical treatment the next day. Her test result came back
positive for COVID-19 infection on 8 April and she was conveyed in an
ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Another test
conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory on 9 April was
negative for COVID-19 infection. Her serological test result has come
back positive, which is indicative of a past infection. She could be
shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer
transmissible and infective to others, but given that we are not able to
definitively conclude when she had been infected, we will take all the
necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.



B)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.



C)  IMPORTED CASES: 31

•  1 (Case 61797) is a Singaporean who returned from Papua
New Guinea.

Student's Pass holders who arrived from India.
•  3 (Cases 61762, 61805 and 61806) are Work Pass holders who

•  15 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh,

holders. Case 61769 arrived from India with her spouse who is working
here. Case 61808 arrived from Malaysia to visit his family member who is
a Singapore Permanent Resident.

They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.

4.  Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.

5.  Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

6.  18 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,322 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

7.  There are currently 45 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 236 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed
