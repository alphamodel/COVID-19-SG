The cases, who were confirmed between 2 November and 11 November to have COVID-19 infection, were observed to have high genetic similarity despite having arrived from different countries. From MOH\u2019s preliminary investigations, we cannot exclude that transmissions could have occurred at Mandarin Orchard Singapore.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all guests, the hotel has stopped accepting new guests and is checking out existing guests progressively. Persons serving SHN will be transported via dedicated vehicles to an alternative SHN dedicated facility. Deep cleaning and disinfection will be carried out by the hotel, in consultation with MOH and the National Environment Agency. MOH has commenced a special testing operations to test around 500 staff of the hotel for COVID-19 infection.

Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 62 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

It takes about four weeks to culture the virus and complete the genome sequencing. 13 imported cases, who were confirmed between 2 November and 11 November to have COVID-19 infection, were observed to have high genetic similarity despite the cases having arrived from different countries, including Bahrain, Canada, Indonesia, Myanmar, Netherlands, Philippines, South Korea, UAE, UK and US. This suggests that these cases were likely infected from a similar source.

They should see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose), as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">Hotels used as SHN dedicated facilities must have in place strict protocols to segregate persons on SHN from all other guests. These include placing persons on SHN in segregated blocks, wings or floors, and ensuring their route of movement is clearly demarcated from other guests. Persons on SHN are also not allowed to leave their rooms during their stay, and rooms are thoroughly disinfected and sanitised upon completion of SHN according to strict infection control measures. They will also not be allowed access to common facilities in the hotels. The Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore Police Force conduct regular checks on these hotels to ensure that safe management measures are complied with, and that security measures are in place. The Government takes a serious view of any breach in protocols and will investigate and take actions should there be non-compliance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\"><br clear=\"all\"> </span></p><div><hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"> <div id=\"ftn1\"> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;\">[1] Cases 58204, 58235, 58233, 58236, 58237, 58234, 58244, 58245, 58253, 58252, 58268, 58281 and 58284.
