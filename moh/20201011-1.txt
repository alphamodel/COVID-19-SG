2.               Overall, the number of new cases in the community has
decreased from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an
average of 1 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in
the community has also decreased from an average of 1 case per day in
the week before, to none in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
3.               All the new cases today are imported or linked to known
cases/ clusters.
CASE DETAILS
A)    CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0

There are no cases in the community today.

B)    CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 3

Amongst the 3 cases residing in dormitories, 2 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status, even though they are asymptomatic.

The remaining case was detected through our bi-weekly Rostered Routine
Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up
cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to
ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively
containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.

C)    IMPORTED CASES: 7

Amongst the 7 imported cases, 2 (Cases 58028 and 58029) are Singapore
Permanent Residents who returned from Indonesia. Another 3 cases (Cases
58022, 58024 and 58025) are Work Permit holders currently employed in
Singapore who arrived from Malaysia and the Philippines. The remaining 2
cases (Cases 58023 and 58030) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived
from the Philippines and Saudi Arabia.

They had all been placed on 14-day SHN upon arrival in Singapore, and
were tested while serving SHN even though all of them are asymptomatic.

4.               Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
5.               Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
6.               MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any
further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the
clusters at Kranji Lodge I (12 Kranji Road) and Westlite Woodlands
dormitory (2 Woodlands Sector 2) for the past two incubation periods
(i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
7.               Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
Please refer to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
8.               7 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,705 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.
9.               There are currently 44 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 100 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
