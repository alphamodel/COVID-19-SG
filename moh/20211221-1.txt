has met quality, safety and efficacy standards and has been approved by
the Health Sciences Authority for use in children aged 5 to 11 years.
The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has also recommended its
use for this age group.



3.  The Ministry of Health is working with the Ministry of
Education (MOE) and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) on

operational details will be announced shortly by MOE and ECDA.

COVID-19. The extension of vaccination to include children aged 5 to 11

COVID-19 situation, and we encourage everyone who is eligible to be
vaccinated when the it is offered to them.
