14 NEW CASES OF LOCALLY TRANSMITTED COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 02 May 2021

As of 2 May 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and
verified that there are 14 new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19
infection. 13 are linked to previous cases, and they are either patients
and staff at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) or close contacts who had
already been placed on quarantine. 1 is currently unlinked, but has high
Ct value (i.e. low viral load) and positive serology test, which may be
indicative of an old infection. In addition, there are 25 imported
cases, who had already been placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated
upon arrival in Singapore. Amongst the new cases today, 28 are
asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and
surveillance, while 11 were symptomatic.

CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 14
There are 14 cases in the community today, of whom 13 are linked to
previous cases and 1 is currently unlinked.
Case 62734
Case 62734 is a 37 year-old female India national who is a foreign
domestic worker. She arrived from India on 13 January and served SHN at
a dedicated facility until 27 January. Her test taken on 26 January
during SHN was negative for COVID-19. Following her SHN, she was
deployed to her employer’s place of residence.
She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 29 April in preparation for her return to India.
Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to
Mount Elizabeth Hospital in an ambulance. Her Ct value was very high,
which is indicative of a low viral load, and her serology test result
has come back positive. She could be shedding minute fragments of the
virus RNA from a past infection which are no longer transmissible and
infective to others, but given that we are not able to definitively
conclude when she had been infected, we will take all the necessary
public health actions as a precautionary measure.
