432 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 86 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 16 Aug 2020

          As of 16 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 86 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:

A)  IMPORTED CASES: 6 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Pass holder, 3
Dependant’s Pass holders, 1 Student’s Pass holder)

Amongst the 6 imported cases, 1 (Case 55805) is a Singaporean who
returned to Singapore from Indonesia on 4 August. Another 3 cases (Cases
55754, 55807 and 55808) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from
India on 31 July and the Philippines on 4 August. Another case (Case
55794), who is a Work Pass holder currently employed in Singapore,
arrived from the Philippines on 4 August. The remaining case (Case
55810) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from Russia on 4 August.

All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated
facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.

B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Permit
holder)

Both cases (Cases 55804 and 55790) in the community had been identified
as contacts of previously confirmed cases. They had been placed on
quarantine earlier, and were tested during quarantine to determine their
status. Case 55790 is a technician who had boarded the affected vessel
(reported in yesterday’s press release) on 9 August to carry out
essential repair and maintenance work. He was subsequently placed on
quarantine when some crew members were confirmed to have COVID-19, and
swabbed even though he is asymptomatic.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 78

The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in
the dormitories. There are currently about 19,900 workers who are still
serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when
their quarantine ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in
the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.  Of the new cases, 98% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

4.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

5.  432 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 51,953 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

6.  There are currently 82 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 3,685 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
