CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 14
Amongst the 14 imported cases, 6 (Cases 58735, 58737, 58741, 58745,
58747 and 58748) are Singaporeans and 2 (Cases 58746 and 58749) are
Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from South Africa, Republic
of Korea, UK, US, Philippines, Malaysia and India. In addition, there is
1 Work Pass holder (Case 58738) and 3 Work Permit holders (Cases 58736,
58740 and 58744) who arrived from Indonesia and India. The 2 remaining
cases (Cases 58739 and 58743) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived
from India and US. They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated
upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or under
isolation.
Case 58741 arrived from the UK on 7 December, and served 14-day SHN at a
dedicated facility until 21 December. He was swabbed on 17 December, and
his test result was negative for COVID-19 infection. He subsequently
developed a cough on 23 December, and was tested positive at a hospital
on the same day. His original sample was tested by the National Public
Health Laboratory (NPHL), and was confirmed to be positive for COVID-19
infection. However a second sample taken on 24 December by NPHL came
back negative for the virus. His serological test result has come back
positive, which indicates a likely past infection. He is therefore
likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no
longer transmissible and infective to others.
Case 58746 arrived from the Philippines on 10 December, and served SHN
at Mandarin Orchard Singapore. He was moved to another dedicated
facility on 20 December when MOH commenced investigations into the 13
previously reported cases who had served SHN at Mandarin Orchard
Singapore between 22 October and 11 November 2020. He was swabbed on 19
December and 21 December and his test results came back negative for
COVID-19 infection. As a precautionary measure, he was swabbed again on
completion of SHN on 24 December, and went home following the test. His
test result came back positive that night and he was conveyed to the
hospital the next day. Investigations are ongoing to assess if he could
be linked to the 13 cases. His serological test result is pending.
3.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
4.  Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.    20 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,352 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.    There are currently 31 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 97 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
