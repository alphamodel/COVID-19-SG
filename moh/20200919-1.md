    <body><h1>71 More Cases Discharged, 15 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 19 Sep 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 19 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 15 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>Summary of new cases<br></strong><br>Amongst the new cases today, 13 are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance, while 2 were symptomatic.&nbsp;<br></p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center"><strong>Already in quarantine/ isolation before detection</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center"><strong>Detected from surveillance</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center"><strong>Total</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p><strong>Imported cases</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">5</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">0</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">5</p></td></tr><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p><strong>Cases in the community</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">0</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">1</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">1</p></td></tr><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p><strong>Cases residing in dormitories</strong></p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">6</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">3</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">9</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><br>a) <strong>Imported cases: 5</strong> (1 Work Permit holder, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder, 1 Student’s Pass holder, 2 Long-Term Visit Pass holders)</span><br></p><div style="text-align: justify;">Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 57700) is a Work Permit holder currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India on 8 September. 2 (Cases 57691 and 57694) are Long-Term Visit Pass holders who arrived from India on 6 September. Another case (Case 57689) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from Iran on 15 September and the remaining case (Case 57692) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from India on 6 September.&nbsp;<br><br>All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>b) <strong>Cases in the community: 1</strong> (1 Singaporean)<br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 57699 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.&nbsp;<br><br>Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the meantime, all his identified close contacts have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for his household contacts to determine if he could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 9<br></strong><br>Amongst the 9 cases residing in dormitories, 6 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 3 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
