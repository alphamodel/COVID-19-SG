    <p>Published Date: 08 Aug 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 8 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 132 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 6 </strong>(1 Work Pass holder, 2 Work Permit holders, 3 Dependant’s Pass holders)<br><br>Amongst the 6 imported cases, 3 (Cases 54960, 54971 and 54972) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders who are currently employed in Singapore. They arrived in Singapore from India and Indonesia on 27 July. The remaining 3 cases (Cases 54952, 54961 and 54970) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from India on 27 July and the US on 26 July.&nbsp;<br><br>All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 1</strong>&nbsp; (1 Singaporean)<br><br>There is 1 case in the community today (Case 54969) who had been identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. She was tested during quarantine to determine her status.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 14 days. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 125</strong><br><br>The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in the dormitories on 7 August, except for a few standalone blocks in the dormitories that serve as quarantine facilities. The workers in these quarantine facilities will be tested when their isolation ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
