He arrived from the Netherlands on 10 February, and tested negative for COVID-19 upon arrival in Singapore. He was subsequently on a controlled itinerary, which was largely limited to his place of work on a vessel docked in Singapore and his accommodation. As part of our regular testing of such travellers, he was tested again on 12 February and his test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection. He was asymptomatic at the time of testing, but developed a fever on 13 February. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Given his recent travel history, we have classified this as an imported case.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/moh-press-release---annex-a-and-b-(14-feb-2021)-(1).pdf?sfvrsn=83f02ce9_0\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are in progress.
