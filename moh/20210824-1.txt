Community surveillance testing for visitors to Bugis Junction

12.     MOH is investigating 20 cases of COVID-19 infection amongst
individuals who work in Bugis Junction (200 Victoria Street). Staff who
have been working in affected shops at Bugis Junction will be tested,
and close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined. To uncover
any community infection cases, we will also extend free COVID-19 testing
to members of the public who had visited the retail shops or used the
services/ facilities at Bugis Junction between 17 August and 24 August.
Individuals who had only walked through the mall to connect to
neighbouring buildings or Bugis MRT station need not be tested. Please
refer to https://go.gov.sg/bugis-junction-testing for details on the
testing operations.

13. All visitors to Bugis Junction between 17 August and 24 August
are advised to monitor their health closely, and minimise social
interactions as far as possible, for 14 days from their date of visit.
They are encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.

14.      Please refer to MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
