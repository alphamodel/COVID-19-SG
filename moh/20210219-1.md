    <body><h1>No New Cases of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 19 Feb 2021</p> 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 19 February 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified that there are no new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. There are 14 imported cases, who had already been placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. Amongst the new cases today, 13 are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance, while 1 was symptomatic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Summary of new cases</strong><div><br><div dir="ltr" align="left"><table><colgroup><col width="129"><col width="60"><col width="16"><col width="96"><col width="96"><col width="16"><col width="96"><col width="96"></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><strong><br></strong></td><td><strong><br></strong></td><td colspan="2"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Breakdown by</strong></p></td><td colspan="2"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Breakdown by</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong><br></strong></td><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Number of cases</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Already in quarantine/ isolation before detection</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Detected from surveillance</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Symptomatic</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Asymptomatic</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cases in the community</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cases residing in dormitories</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">0</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Imported cases</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr">14</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">13</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">1</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">1</p></td><td><p dir="ltr">13</p></td></tr><tr><td><p dir="ltr"><strong>Total</strong></p></td><td><p dir="ltr">14</p></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td><td><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from 8 cases in the week before to 1 case in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from 5 cases in the week before to 1 case in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst the 69 confirmed cases reported from 13 February to 19 February, 44 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 10 have tested negative, and 15 serology test results are pending.<br><br><strong>Case Details</strong><br><br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases in the community today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 14</strong><br><br>Amongst the 14 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>• 1 (Case 60324) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from Indonesia.<br>• 3 (Cases 60318, 60323 and 60337) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from India and Indonesia.<br>• 4 (Cases 60316, 60319, 60321 and 60325) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India, Nepal and the UAE.<br>• 3 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Indonesia and Malaysia, of whom 1 (Case 60322) is a foreign domestic worker.<br>• 3 (Cases 60328, 60329 and 60330) are Special Pass holders who are sea crew, and arrived from Malaysia and the UAE. They had not disembarked from their vessels and were tested onboard.&nbsp;<br><br>They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.&nbsp;<br><br>Of these, 13 are not required to undergo mandatory on-arrival serology tests upon arrival<span style="font-size: 10.8333px;"><sup>1</sup></span>. The remaining case tested positive for her on-arrival serology test, but as we are unable to definitively conclude that she was no longer infectious when she arrived in Singapore, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.<br><br>Case 60316 is a Work Pass holder who arrived from India on 30 December 2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 3 January 2021. As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 58944, he was subsequently placed on quarantine from 3 January to 13 January. His swabs done on 4 January and 10 January during quarantine were negative for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 17 February in preparation for his return to India. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load. Another sample taken on 18 February tested negative for COVID-19. His serological test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annexes---19-feb-2021.pdf?sfvrsn=a7d52902_2" title="Annexes">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH’s daily Situation Report (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 18 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,697 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are currently 20 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 100 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.<br><br>[1]&nbsp;From 5 February, newly arrived Work Permit and S Pass holders in the Construction, Marine and Process sectors, foreign domestic workers and confinement nannies, who have recent travel history to higher-risk countries/ regions, are required to undergo mandatory on-arrival serology tests, in addition to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.</div></div></body>
