251 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 249 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 15 Jul 2020

      As of 15 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 249 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 5 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Pass holder, 1 Student’s
Pass holder, 1 Long-Term Visit Pass holder, 1 Short-Term Visit Pass
holder)
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 46809) is a Singaporean who
returned from India on 3 July. Another 2 cases (Cases 46744 and 46795)
are Work Pass or Student’s Pass holders who are currently employed or
study in Singapore.  Another case (Case 46743) is a Long-Term Visit Pass
holder whose spouse is a Singapore Permanent Resident. All of them had
been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore,
and had been tested while serving their SHN.
The remaining case (Case 46802) had been conveyed in a dedicated
transport from Changi Airport to a vessel at Jurong Port upon arrival in
Singapore, where he had remained until he was placed on quarantine at a
government quarantine facility.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 15 [1] (3 Work Pass holders, 12 Work Permit
holders)
Of the 15 cases in the community, 11 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 3 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. 14 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected
through our proactive testing.
5 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters.
Of these, 3 cases (Cases 46766, 46942 and 46943) had been identified as
contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been tested during their
quarantine to determine their status, even though they are asymptomatic.
The remaining 2 cases (Cases 46807 and 46812) are also asymptomatic, and
were swabbed as part of our periodic screening of workers in the
construction sector.
10 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 9 cases had
been detected as a result of our screening of workers in essential
services who are living outside the dormitories. Epidemiological
investigations are ongoing for the remaining case (Case 46730), who was
swabbed under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals
aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at
first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to detect infected
individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.
Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to
determine if these cases could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 14 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 13 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
increased, from an average of 6 cases per day in the week before, to an
average of 8 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 229
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.   Of the new cases, 94% are linked to known clusters, while the rest
are pending contact tracing.
4.   The Inter-Agency Task Force has been systematically and
progressively clearing dormitories through aggressive testing of migrant
workers residing in dormitories. The dormitory at 11 Tuas Avenue 10 has
been cleared, and now houses only recovered individuals and those who
have recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As such, the
cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.   In the past week (8 July to 14 July), MOH has uncovered links for
11 previously unlinked cases.
6.   Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.    251 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 42,988 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.   There are currently 159 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 3,704 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still
test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due
to COVID-19 infection.
