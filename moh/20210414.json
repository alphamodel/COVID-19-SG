It will work in the public and patients\u2019 best interest in providing recommendations on ensuring quality, safe, cost-effective and affordable healthcare for Singaporeans. It will recommend improvements to manage rising healthcare costs in the current healthcare insurance system. It will also guide the establishment of platforms to address complaints and conflicts arising from healthcare insurance claims.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; The involvement of AMS, FBAC, LIA, SMA and private hospitals in the Committee provides opportunity for the stakeholders to work collaboratively towards the shared objectives of the MHIC, and be ambassadors for decisions taken by the MHIC. CASE\u2019s participation will also help to represent and uphold policyholders\u2019 interests.<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; The MHIC stems from an earlier Pro-Tem Committee established in October 2020 between AMS, LIA and SMA, to facilitate discussions related to Integrated Shield Plans (IPs). Since its inception, the Pro-Tem Committee has made progress over issues such as the amendment of IP contracts\u2019 exclusion clauses to cover medically indicated diagnostic procedures, improving consumer education on IP, improving panel sizes and facilitating the setting of panel fees to be within the MOH Fee Benchmarks.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; The MHIC will build on the work of the Pro-Tem Committee, and will focus on key priority areas including improvements to the accessibility and transparency of IP doctor panels, enhancements to the claims pre-authorisation process for treatment, and improving transparency across the board. More details on the MHIC\u2019s recommendations will be released when ready.<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; MOH will continue to work collaboratively with all stakeholders to strike a balance between preserving patient choice, while ensuring quality, cost-effective and sustainable care.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;<br>14 APRIL 2021</strong><br><div><br></div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "moh-appoints-multilateral-healthcare-insurance-committee", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "1 New Case of Locally Transmitted  Covid-19 Infection", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1618385760000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "14 Apr 2021", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 14 April 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 1 new case of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection.
