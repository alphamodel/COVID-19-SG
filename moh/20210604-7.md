    <p>Published Date: 04 Jun 2021</p> <span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has reviewed the incident where a 16 year-old youth had been erroneously administered the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3 June 2021.<br><br>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is currently authorised for use in Singapore for individuals aged 18 and above. Data from a trial&nbsp; involving more than 3,700 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years old has found that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective among adolescents with no significant safety issues identified. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and the common ones were injection site pain, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and chills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Expert Committee for COVID-19 Vaccination does not expect any safety issues from the receipt of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in the 16-year-old youth, and the medical team will consult the Expert Committee on what would be best for the youth for the completion of the vaccination.&nbsp;<br><br>4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Expert Committee will continue to closely monitor the global evidence and developments on COVID-19 vaccines, in particular the emerging data on the efficacy and safety of vaccine use for more population subgroups, as more people are vaccinated globally and locally.<br><br><br><strong>EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION<br>4 JUNE 2021</strong></span><br><div><br></div></body>
