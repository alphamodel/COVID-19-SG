UPDATE ON VACCINATION PROGRESS

1.     As of 22 August 2021, we have administered a total of 8,588,011
doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme
(Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty and Moderna), covering 4,477,965 individuals,
with 4,238,764 individuals having completed the full vaccination
regimen.

2.     In addition, 159,438 doses of other vaccines recognised in the
World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been
administered as of 22 August 2021, covering 84,982 individuals. In
total, 78% of our population has completed their full regimen/ received
two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 82% has received at least one dose.

CONDITION OF HOSPITALISED CASES

3.     336 cases are currently warded in hospital. There are currently
21 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 7 in
critical condition in the ICU. Of those who have fallen very ill, 22 are
seniors above 60 years, of whom 18 are completely unvaccinated or
partially vaccinated.

4.     Case 67375, an 86 year-old female Singaporean, has passed away
from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 23 August 2021. Her case
was first reported on 2 August. She had been admitted to Changi General
Hospital on 23 July for an unrelated medical condition, and tested
negative for COVID-19 during admission and again on 29 July. She was
detected when she was tested on 2 August as she had been identified as a
close contact of a patient who was a confirmed case. She had not been
vaccinated against COVID-19, and had a history of cancer and
hypertension. In total, 50 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.

5.     There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 8.8%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 1.7%.
