A) IMPORTED CASES: 4 (3 PERMANENT RESIDENTS, 1 WORK PASS HOLDER)
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 3 (Cases 57776, 57782 and 57783) are
Singapore Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India on 11
September. The remaining case (Case 57781) is a Work Pass holder
currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Iran on 11 September.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 WORK PERMIT HOLDER)
Case 57775 had been identified as a contact of a previously confirmed
case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. He was tested during
quarantine to determine his status, even though he is asymptomatic.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked
cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of fewer
than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 7

Amongst the 7 cases residing in dormitories, 4 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.

The remaining 3 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.

2.           Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.           Of the new cases, 92% are imported or linked to known
cases/ clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.           Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.           29 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,291 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.
6.             There are currently 36 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 285 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
