He was subsequently transferred to the National University Hospital (NUH) in the evening, where he is in critical condition at the intensive care unit. </span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine on 27 June. He was assessed by trained healthcare personnel to be suitable for COVID-19 vaccination, observed on-site for about 30 minutes post-vaccination and was well. He was also well for the following five days after vaccination. Prior to his collapse on 3 July, he did weightlifting at the gym. MOH understands that he trains with very heavy weights which were above his body weight.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">We are in contact with the medical team in NUH who are providing close medical care for the patient. The preliminary diagnosis of his condition is an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Clinical and laboratory tests are in progress to understand the underlying cause. We will also work with the medical team in NUH to determine if this might be linked to his COVID-19 vaccination. This will include a thorough consideration of whether there was acute severe myocarditis, which is severe inflammation of the heart muscles affecting the heart function, as a possible diagnosis.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination will monitor the outcome of this investigation.</span></p></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">The Expert Committee and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) have reviewed additional local and overseas data, independently of this incident. MOH concurs with the recommendations by both the Expert Committee and HSA for vaccinated persons to avoid strenuous physical activity after either the first or second COVID-19 vaccination dose. We advise all persons, in particular adolescents and younger men aged less than 30 years old, to avoid strenuous physical activity for seven days after their vaccination, be it the first or second doses, as a further precautionary measure.</span></p></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><strong style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">MINISTRY OF HEALTH</strong><br></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\"><strong>5 JULY 2021</strong></span></p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "updated-advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "Expert Committee On Covid-19 Vaccination: Updates of Assessment On Myocarditis and Pericarditis Following Vaccination With Mrna Covid-19 Vaccines", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1625475000000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "05 Jul 2021", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given the emerging data on the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis observed after vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination recommends that all vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger men, who have received any dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, should avoid any exercise or strenuous physical activity for one week after vaccination. During this time, the vaccinated persons should seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.

The recommendations are now being updated based on the additional data that has since accrued both locally and internationally.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In its third COVID-19 vaccine safety update released on 5 July 2021, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) highlighted that as of 30 June 2021, it had received 12 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring in individuals following their vaccinations with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Five of the cases occurred in adults aged 30 years old and above. Seven of the cases involved males aged below 30 years old, which is higher than expected for this age group, based on background incidence rates. While most of the cases reported previously had occurred after dose 2 of their vaccination, HSA had also started to receive reports of some cases that occurred after dose 1. The Expert Committee has also been informed of a case of a 16-year-old male who suffered a cardiac arrest, shortly after a strenuous weightlifting session at a gym that took place 6 days after receiving his first dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Investigations are on-going into the cause, including the possibility of acute severe myocarditis, underlying conditions that can result in this, as well as possible links with his COVID-19 vaccination. While most persons with vaccine-related myocarditis observed locally and internationally have mild symptoms and make an uneventful recovery, it is possible that the condition may be aggravated by factors or strenuous activities that may affect the heart.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\"><strong>Expert Committee\u2019s Recommendations</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given the additional data on the small but nevertheless statistically-significant risk of myocarditis/pericarditis occurring after vaccination with both the first and second doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the Expert Committee recommends that all vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger men, who have received any dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, should avoid exercise or strenuous physical activity for one w</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">eek after the vaccination.

Vaccinations should continue to remain voluntary.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;COVID-19 is likely to become endemic in Singapore and around the world. Even with high vaccination rates in our population, settings with low overall levels of vaccination will continue to be susceptible to outbreaks. The risk of transmission and outbreak in settings such as schools or workplaces where there is close contact amongst individuals will likely be higher. Infection of unvaccinated individuals can lead to severe disease and long-term complications, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. As previously indicated, overseas experience shows that a small but significant proportion of children diagnosed with COVID-19 can require intensive care and have poor health outcomes. Despite low COVID-19 cases currently, explosive outbreaks with highly transmissible new variants are unpredictable, as shown in our recent experience with the Delta variant and similar experiences overseas. Vaccination is thus important to protect all individuals from COVID-19, even for young persons.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The use of safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore is of paramount concern to the Expert Committee, and the Expert Committee will continue to monitor local and international data to ensure our vaccination recommendations are up to date based on the latest scientific evidence available.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION</strong></span><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\"><strong>5 JULY 2021</strong></span></p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "expert-committee-on-covid-19-vaccination-updates-of-assessment-on-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-following-vaccination-with-mrna-covid-19-vaccines", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "6 New Cases of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1625470800000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "05 Jul 2021", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 5 July 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 6 new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. 4 are linked to previous cases, and have already been placed on quarantine. 2 are currently unlinked.<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, there are 7 imported cases, who have already been placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. 5 were detected upon arrival in Singapore, while 2 developed the illness during SHN or isolation. <br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In total, there are 13 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore today. <br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>5 JULY 2021</strong></p> </div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "6-new-cases-of-locally-transmitted-covid-19-infection5JULY", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
