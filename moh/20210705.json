Five of the cases occurred in adults aged 30 years old and above. Seven of the cases involved males aged below 30 years old, which is higher than expected for this age group, based on background incidence rates. While most of the cases reported previously had occurred after dose 2 of their vaccination, HSA had also started to receive reports of some cases that occurred after dose 1. The Expert Committee has also been informed of a case of a 16-year-old male who suffered a cardiac arrest, shortly after a strenuous weightlifting session at a gym that took place 6 days after receiving his first dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Investigations are on-going into the cause, including the possibility of acute severe myocarditis, underlying conditions that can result in this, as well as possible links with his COVID-19 vaccination. While most persons with vaccine-related myocarditis observed locally and internationally have mild symptoms and make an uneventful recovery, it is possible that the condition may be aggravated by factors or strenuous activities that may affect the heart.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\"><strong>Expert Committee\u2019s Recommendations</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given the additional data on the small but nevertheless statistically-significant risk of myocarditis/pericarditis occurring after vaccination with both the first and second doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, the Expert Committee recommends that all vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger men, who have received any dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, should avoid exercise or strenuous physical activity for one w</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">eek after the vaccination.

Vaccinations should continue to remain voluntary.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;COVID-19 is likely to become endemic in Singapore and around the world. Even with high vaccination rates in our population, settings with low overall levels of vaccination will continue to be susceptible to outbreaks. The risk of transmission and outbreak in settings such as schools or workplaces where there is close contact amongst individuals will likely be higher. Infection of unvaccinated individuals can lead to severe disease and long-term complications, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. As previously indicated, overseas experience shows that a small but significant proportion of children diagnosed with COVID-19 can require intensive care and have poor health outcomes. Despite low COVID-19 cases currently, explosive outbreaks with highly transmissible new variants are unpredictable, as shown in our recent experience with the Delta variant and similar experiences overseas. Vaccination is thus important to protect all individuals from COVID-19, even for young persons.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The use of safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore is of paramount concern to the Expert Committee, and the Expert Committee will continue to monitor local and international data to ensure our vaccination recommendations are up to date based on the latest scientific evidence available.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION</strong></span><strong><br></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\"><strong>5 JULY 2021</strong></span></p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "expert-committee-on-covid-19-vaccination-updates-of-assessment-on-myocarditis-and-pericarditis-following-vaccination-with-mrna-covid-19-vaccines", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "6 New Cases of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1625470800000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "05 Jul 2021", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 5 July 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 6 new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. 4 are linked to previous cases, and have already been placed on quarantine. 2 are currently unlinked.<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, there are 7 imported cases, who have already been placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. 5 were detected upon arrival in Singapore, while 2 developed the illness during SHN or isolation. <br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In total, there are 13 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore today. <br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>5 JULY 2021</strong></p> </div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "6-new-cases-of-locally-transmitted-covid-19-infection5JULY", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
