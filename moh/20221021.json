This is to protect and support our healthcare workers who are at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19.</span></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eligible healthcare workers aged 18 and above, who have achieved minimum protection (i.e. at least 3 doses of mRNA vaccine/Nuvaxovid or 4 doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac), and who had received their last vaccine dose more than five months ago, are recommended to receive an additional dose of the bivalent vaccine. They may walk in to any of our nine Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) offering the Moderna/Spikevax vaccines to get themselves vaccinated.
