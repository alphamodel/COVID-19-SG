As of 12 March 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed
and verified nine more cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. Of
these:

•  Three (Cases 179, 185 and 186) are part of the cluster

2.  The World Health Organization had on 11 March 2020
declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic, in view of the rising
number of cases reported around the world. Singapore has been planning
ahead, and we have been progressively putting in place a suite of
measures in preparation for a possible escalation of the situation, both
locally and globally. The situation in Singapore remains under control,
and we are not changing the DORSCON level.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

3.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This
was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.

HEALTH ADVISORY

44.  Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei
Province and all non-essential travel to mainland China, Iran, northern
Italy, Japan and the Republic of Korea.

45.  All travellers should monitor their health closely for two
weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if
they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.

46.  Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

•  Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing
symptoms of illness;
•  Observe good personal hygiene;
•  Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before
handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are
dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
•  Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a
cough or shortness of breath;
•  Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or
sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin
immediately; and
•  Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

47.  MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is
likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
