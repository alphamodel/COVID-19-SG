The breakdown of the cases is as follows:\n<br>\n<br><strong>a) Imported cases: 11</strong> (2 Singaporeans, 3 Work Pass holders, 1 Work Permit holder, 4 Dependant\u2019s Pass holders, 1 Special Pass holder)\n<br>\n<br>Amongst the 11 imported cases, 2 are Singaporeans who returned to Singapore from India on 3 July (Case 55439) and from Indonesia on 30 July (Case 55436). Case 55439 is a child who had served his Stay-Home Notice (SHN) with his parent and siblings in the same room at a dedicated facility, and was subsequently placed on quarantine when his SHN contacts tested positive for COVID-19. He was tested during quarantine to verify his status. \n<br>\n<br>4 cases (Cases 55444, 55464, 55465 and 55470) are Dependant\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from India on 28 July and 31 July. Another 4 cases (Cases 55455, 55456, 55457 and 55458) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from the Philippines on 29 July and from India on 31 July. \n<br>\n<br>All of them had been placed on 14-day SHN upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.

The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.\n<br>\n<br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 30\n</strong><br>\n<br>The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in the dormitories. There are currently about 22,800 workers who are still serving out their quarantine period.<sup>1</sup> These workers will be tested when their quarantine ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.\n<br>\n<br>2.

The dormitories at 33 Senoko Way and 23 Sungei Kadut Street 2 have been cleared, and now house only recovered individuals and those who have recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection.
