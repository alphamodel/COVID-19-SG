Published Date: 03 Aug 2020

        As of 3 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 226 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in
foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there is
1 case in the community involving a Prison inmate on Short-Term Visit
Pass, who had arrived in Singapore before the implementation of border
measures. He had been segregated from the general inmate population
since his admission to Changi Prison Complex on 30 July, and was tested
as part of the Singapore Prison Serviceâ€™s proactive screening of newly
admitted inmates.
2.      In addition, there are 9 imported cases, who had all been placed
on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.
3.      We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
