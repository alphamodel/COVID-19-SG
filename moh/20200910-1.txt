A) IMPORTED CASES: 6 (1 Singaporean, 2 Work Pass holders, 2 Work Permit
holders, 1 Student’s Pass holder)
Amongst the 6 imported cases, 1 (Case 57328) is a Singaporean who
returned to Singapore from the UAE on 29 August. Another 4 (Cases 57322,
57324, 57362 and 57363) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently
employed in Singapore who arrived from Bangladesh on 31 August, and
Indonesia and Russia on 29 August. The remaining case (Case 57313) is a
Student’s Pass holder who arrived from the Philippines on 27 August.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Permit holder)
Of the 2 cases in the community, 1 was picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been isolated
earlier.
Case 57312 is linked to previous imported cases (Cases 57145, 57186 and
57272) who are his family members. They had returned from India on 24
August, and were placed on SNH at a dedicated facility upon arrival in
Singapore. While Case 57312 had not travelled overseas with them, he had
requested to take care of his spouse and young children at the SHN
facility, and was isolated with them from 24 August.
There is 1 case in the community who is currently unlinked. Case 57318
was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in
the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the
dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 55
Amongst the 55 cases residing in dormitories, 26 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 29 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
Of the cases residing in dormitories today, 26 are from Avery Lodge, the
majority of whom had been placed on quarantine earlier and were tested
during quarantine to determine their status. The remaining cases were
detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered
Routine Testing.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past
infections [1].  The serological test results for 7 cases have come back
positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     Of the new cases, 97% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     66 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 56,558 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.     There are currently 47 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 597 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
