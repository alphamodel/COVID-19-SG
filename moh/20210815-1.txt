ISSUANCE OF GENERAL CORRECTION DIRECTION UNDER THE PROTECTION FROM ONLINE FALSEHOODS AND MANIPULATION ACT ON FALSEHOODS ON ALLEGED DEATH OF THREE-YEAR-OLD GIRL FROM COVID-19


Published Date: 15 Aug 2021

The Ministry of Health (MOH) is aware of a false statement circulating
online in a Facebook post by a user, Eileen Loh, on 14 August 2021,
about a three-year-old preschooler who had allegedly passed away from
COVID-19 at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), and that the death
was deliberately not reported.
2. The Minister for Health has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a
General Correction Direction¹ to Facebook. Facebook is required to carry
the Correction Notice to all end-users in Singapore who use Facebook.
3. The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication
of these false statements, and criminal investigations under POFMA will
be conducted.

[1] A General Correction Direction is a Direction issued to prescribed
Internet Intermediaries, prescribed telecom and broadcast licensees,
and/or prescribed permit holders of the Newspaper and Printing Presses
Act that would require them to communicate, publish, broadcast or
transmit a correction notice to their users in Singapore. In this case,
Facebook will be required to display a correction notice with a link to
the facts to all Singapore Facebook users. This is to inform them that
there was such a blatant fabrication circulating on the platform, which
they may have come across.
