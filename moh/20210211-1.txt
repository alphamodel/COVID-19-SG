3 NEW CASES OF LOCALLY TRANSMITTED COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 11 Feb 2021

      As of 11 February 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed 3 new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19
infection. Based on our investigations so far, the cases are in the
community, and there are no new cases in the dormitories.
2.       In addition, there are 9 imported cases, who had already been
placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore. In total, there
are 12 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore today.
3.      We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
4.     With increased interactions over the Chinese New Year period,
there will be higher transmission risks in the community. It is
important that everyone remain vigilant and adhere to the safe
management measures. The number of visitors per household per day is
limited to 8 distinct persons. We encourage everyone to connect
digitally with their family and friends instead of going on physical
visits. For those who plan to do house visits, they should limit their
visits to family members and to not more than 2 other households a day.
Face masks must be worn during _lohei_, and there should not be any
verbalisation of the usual auspicious phrases. If we all play our part,
we can continue to keep the number of cases in our community low.
