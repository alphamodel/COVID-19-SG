A) IMPORTED CASES: 5 (1 Permanent Resident, 1 Work Pass holder, 1 Work
Permit holder, 2 Short-Term Visit Pass holders)
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 57555) is a Singapore Permanent
Resident who returned to Singapore from India on 30 August. Another 2
(Cases 57548 and 57554) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently
employed in Singapore who arrived from India on 2 September. Another
case (Case 57551), a Short-Term Visit Pass holder whose parent is a
Singaporean, arrived from India on 5 September. The remaining case (Case
57552), who is also a Short-Term Visit Pass holder, is a technician who
arrived from the US on 1 September on a work project.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 43
Amongst the 43 cases residing in dormitories, 29 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 14 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past
infections.  The serological test results for 31 cases have come back
positive so far, which indicate likely past infection.
2.      Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 96% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.      Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.      38 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 56,802 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.      There are currently 53 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 572 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
