Medifund Continues to Assist Needy Singaporeans With Their Healthcare
Needs



MEDIFUND CONTINUES TO ASSIST NEEDY SINGAPOREANS WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS


Published Date: 30 Nov 2021

1.     The Medical Endowment Fund (MediFund) provided a total of $156.9
million through about 1.2 million successful applications in assistance
to needy Singaporeans for their medical bills in Financial Year (FY)
2020, i.e., for the period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021.



2.     MediFund is a safety net for needy Singaporean patients who are
unable to afford their medical bills, after Government subsidies,
insurance and MediSave. MediFund Silver and MediFund Junior were
introduced in 2007 and 2013 respectively to provide more targeted
assistance for the elderly and children respectively. MediFund ensures
that no Singaporean will be denied basic medical care due to inability
to pay.
3.     The amount disbursed by MediFund in FY2020 was $2.2 million lower
than the $159.1 million disbursed in FY2019. The decrease in assistance
was mainly due to lower number of patient visits to the Public
Healthcare Institutions (PHIs) and Intermediate and Long-term Care
(ILTC) facilities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The key statistics of
MediFund assistance provided in FY2020 are:



i.  The number of approved MediFund applications was 1,150,985. This was
    a 5.3% decrease from the 1,215,809 number of approved applications
    in FY2019, contributed by a decrease in the total number of
    applications over the same period[1];



ii. In PHIs, a total assistance of $120.3 million was provided to
    patients, compared to $122.8 million in FY2019;



iii. In ILTC facilities, a total assistance of $36.6 million was
    provided to patients, compared to $36.2 million in FY2019; and



iv. On average, the amount of MediFund assistance provided was $841 per
    inpatient treatment, and $93 per outpatient treatment.
