Published Date: 08 Oct 2020

        As of 8 October 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified 4 new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19
infection. All 4 reside in dormitories and there is none in the
community. In addition, there are 5 imported cases, who had all been
placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival. All cases
today are asymptomatic and were detected from our proactive screening
and surveillance.

2.       Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained
stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an
average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
3.      Of the new cases, 78% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no new cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 4
Amongst the 4 cases residing in dormitories, 1 had been identified
earlier as a contact of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. He was tested during quarantine to
determine his status.
The remaining 3 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 5
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 57993) is a Singaporean who
returned from Nepal on 25 September. Another 2 cases are currently
employed in Singapore. Case 57994 is an engineer who is on a short-term
work project in Singapore, and arrived from France on 5 October, while
Case 57998 arrived from Japan on 6 October. The remaining 2 (Cases 57995
and 57996) are crew members of a ship which arrived in Singapore from
Malaysia on 23 September. They did not disembark from the ship and were
isolated after Case 57922 had been confirmed to have COVID-19 infection.
They were swabbed while quarantined on the ship, where they had remained
until their test results came back positive for COVID-19 and were then
conveyed by ambulance to a hospital.
They had all been placed on 14-day SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore, and were tested even though all of them are asymptomatic.
4.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
5.      Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
6.      Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.      44 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,668 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.      There are currently 35 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 119 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
