We have reviewed the currently available international and local data. Our assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, i.e., reduction in COVID-19 infections and severe complications even if infected, continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination. </span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\"><strong>Myocarditis and Pericarditis with mRNA Vaccines</strong></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">2<strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively. They occur more often in men compared to women. Patients present with symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. Most cases are mild, recover without the need for significant intervention and do not suffer any long-term effects, although very rarely, severe cases may result in damage to the heart muscles. Myocarditis and pericarditis are separate and distinct conditions from heart attacks which are caused when blood flow to the heart is blocked.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Increased occurrences of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations have been observed overseas (Israel and the United States [US]) in adolescents and young men below the age of 25 years. The risk of this has been estimated to be 1.6 cases per 100,000 doses for mRNA vaccines in the US, which is comparable to the risk of anaphylaxis observed in Singapore. To date, there is no observed incremental risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the first dose of vaccine. </span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Locally, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has reported 4 cases involving young men aged between 18 to 30 years.&nbsp;This is at the upper end of the expected range for this age group, based on background incidence rates.&nbsp; Most of the cases were reported to have occurred within a few days after receiving the second dose of the vaccine.&nbsp; All have recovered or have been discharged well from hospital.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\"><strong>Recommendations</strong></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While further studies and investigations are on-going, the currently available data suggests that there may be a very small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine, particularly in young men. As a precaution, EC19V recommends that vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. During this time, they should seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. </span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;\">6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;COVID-19 continues to be a health threat globally and in Singapore. The emergence of infectious variants can lead to widespread community COVID-19 transmission as well as the risk of severe COVID-19 disease and complications, including long term chronic complications.

Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Closure of ION Orchard from 12 June</span><br><br>6. MOH is investigating 3 cases (Cases 64112, 64114 and 64135) of COVID-19 infection amongst individuals who work in ION Orchard. To break any potential chain of transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, ION Orchard will be closed to all members of the public starting from 12 June 2021 and re-open 4 days later, on 16 June 2021.<br><br>7. In order to disrupt any wider, undetected community transmission, we will conduct special testing operations for staff who have been working in ION Orchard shopping mall from 28 May. We will also extend free COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited the retail shops or used the services/ facilities at ION Orchard between 3 June to 11 June. Individuals who had only walked through the mall to connect to neighbouring buildings or Orchard MRT station need not be tested. Please refer to <a href=\"http://go.gov.sg/ion-testing\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">http://go.gov.sg/ion-testing</a>&nbsp;for details on the testing operations.<br><br>8. All visitors to ION Orchard between 3 June and 11 June are advised to monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for 14 days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>9. 34 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 61,799 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.<br><br>10. There are currently 133 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 279 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
