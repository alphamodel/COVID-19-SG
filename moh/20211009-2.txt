EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION RECOMMENDS A BOOSTER DOSE OF MRNA COVID-19 VACCINE FOR ALL HEALTHCARE AND FRONTLINE WORKERS


Published Date: 09 Oct 2021

        The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) further
recommends that the following persons should receive a booster dose of a
PSAR mRNA vaccine from six months after the completion of the two-dose
primary vaccination (refer to Annex):
a.      Healthcare and frontline workers
b.      Persons and staff in institutionalised settings
c.      Persons aged 30 years and above
BOOSTER VACCINATION ENHANCES PROTECTION
2.      While two doses of the vaccine provide excellent protection
against severe disease, we have evidence that there is waning protection
against infection over time. Locally, an increased risk of
vaccine-breakthrough infections has been observed, starting from around
six months after the completion of the first two vaccine doses. This is
contributing to the high daily rates of new COVID 19 infections locally,
although protection against severe disease remains high. Booster
vaccination is therefore needed to reduce COVID-19 infection and
transmission.
3.      There is now good international data that a booster dose of the
vaccine is safe, enhances protection against COVID-19 infection and
ensures continued excellent protection against severe disease.
PERSONS RECOMMENDED FOR BOOSTER VACCINATION
4.      Healthcare and frontline workers are more likely to come into
regular contact with COVID-19 cases in the course of their work and are
at greater risk of infection. Many healthcare and frontline workers were
vaccinated at the start of our National Vaccination Programme.
Healthcare and frontline workers vaccinated then were observed to have a
1.4 to 2 times greater risk of being infected in the current surge.
Furthermore, they may care for vulnerable persons such as the elderly
and persons with medical conditions, and play a crucial role in
maintaining our healthcare and frontline services. A booster vaccination
in these workers would raise the level of protection of individuals in
these groups and will preserve our healthcare capacity as well as
frontline services critical to Singapore and our COVID-19 response.
5.      Persons and staff in institutionalised settings, such as prisons
and residential care facilities, are at risk of large COVID-19 outbreaks
and some have already suffered such incidents. Some individuals in these
settings may also be more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications. It is
important to optimise protection in such populations against infection
and minimise the risk of transmission in these settings by offering
booster vaccinations. This will be an expansion from the previous
booster recommendation for residents of aged care facilities.
6.      In order to raise the overall population protection against
infection and severe disease from COVID-19, a booster vaccination is now
also recommended for persons aged 30 years and above.
7.      At present, persons who have recovered from COVID-19 and were
fully vaccinated before their infection, do not need a booster dose.
Recovered persons who were unvaccinated, or partially vaccinated before
their infection, should receive one dose of mRNA vaccine at least 3
months after infection to reduce their risk of reinfection, as part of
their primary series vaccination. No booster dose is recommended yet, at
this time.
BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE RISKS
8.      Data thus far on booster vaccinations has shown that the safety
profile of the third dose is similar to that for the first two doses,
i.e., very safe. EC19V has assessed that the protective benefits of the
booster vaccination, with a reduction in the risks of infection and
severe disease, outweigh the risks of the additional dose in the
recommended groups.
9.      The risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with the first two doses of
the mRNA vaccines is extremely rare but has a higher incidence among
adolescents and younger adults. Israel, with more than 2.5 million doses
of booster vaccinations administered, has not observed a further
increase in the risk of myocarditis/pericarditis with the booster dose
thus far.
10.     Persons younger than the age of 30 years old who are neither
healthcare workers, frontline workers nor persons belonging to
institutional settings are not yet recommended to receive the booster
vaccination at this time. They would have completed their primary series
vaccinations recently.  Furthermore, relative to those working in the
higher-risk settings, they generally do not have a greater risk of
infection. They also have a low risk of developing severe disease from
COVID-19 infection due to their younger age. EC19V will continue to
monitor the data on booster vaccinations for this group, before making
further recommendations.
11.     Persons who are recommended for booster vaccination should
receive a booster dose of a PSAR mRNA vaccine from about six months
after the completion of their primary series vaccination with two doses.
Priority should be given to healthcare and frontline workers due to
their higher exposure risks. The prevailing minimum age criteria for the
PSAR mRNA vaccines and medical contraindications will continue to apply.
12.     Other vaccines available locally under the Special Access Route
(SAR) should only be used according to WHO EULâ€™s approved age groups and
indications, and currently there is inadequate data to support their use
as booster vaccines.
CONCLUSION
13.     EC19V will continue to monitor the global data and developments
around COVID-19 vaccination and is assessing the suitability of booster
vaccinations for other population groups, particularly persons under the
age of 30 years.
