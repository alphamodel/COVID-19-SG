2.        Overall, the number of new cases in the community has
increased from 2 cases in the week before, to 4 in the past week. The
number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from none
in the week before, to 2 cases in the past week. We will continue to
closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 2
There are 2 cases residing in dormitories today, of whom 1 had been
identified earlier as a contact of previous cases, and had already been
quarantined to prevent further transmission. He was tested during
quarantine to determine his status.
The remaining case was detected through our bi-weekly Rostered Routine
Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up
cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to
ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively
containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 4
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 1 is a Singaporean (Case 58083) and
another is a Singapore Permanent Resident (Case 58086) who returned to
Singapore from Indonesia and India respectively. The remaining cases
(Cases 58080 and 58082) are Work Pass holders currently employed in
Singapore who arrived from the UAE and Germany. They had all been placed
on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.
3.          Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
4.        Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.        No new cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,819 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.          There are currently 38 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 36 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
