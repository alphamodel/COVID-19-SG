TWO MORE CASES DISCHARGED; THREE NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 22 Feb 2020

                   Two more cases of COVID-19 infection have been
discharged from hospital today (Cases 19 and 28). In all, 49 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.
2.                As of 22 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health
(MOH) has confirmed and verified three more cases of COVID-19 infection
in Singapore. Of these, one is linked to the cluster at Grace Assembly
of God, and one was among the group of Singaporeans who were evacuated
from Wuhan on 9 February. Contact tracing is underway for the remaining
case to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to
China.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
3.                Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
This was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police
Force.
a)   Four of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38
and 83), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and
Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road).
b)   Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34
and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).
c)   Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to
the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22
January.
d)   Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are
linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.
e)   23 of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60,
61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84 and 88) are
linked to the Grace Assembly of God.
4.                Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In
addition to the clusters, our investigations have identified the
following links between cases:

-   Case 44 is linked to Cases 13 and 26;
-   Case 72 is linked to Cases 59 and 79;
-   Case 50 is linked to Cases 55, 65 and 77;
-   Case 75 is linked to Case 41; and
-   Case 86 is linked to Case 82.

5.                Contact tracing is underway for the other nine locally
transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel
history to mainland China.
ABOUT THE CONFIRMED CASES
Case 87
6.                Case 87 is a 32 year-old male Singapore Citizen who
was among the group of Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on 9
February. He was without symptoms when he boarded the flight and was put
under quarantine upon landing in Singapore. He is currently warded in an
isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). He
is linked to Case 76[1].
7.                All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for
COVID-19 as an added precaution. He was confirmed to have COVID-19
infection on 21 February afternoon.
Case 88
8.                Case 88 is a 30 year-old female Singapore Citizen who
has no recent travel history to China. She is currently warded in an
isolation room at NCID. She is linked to Case 66[2].
9.                She reported onset of symptoms on 16 February and had
sought treatment at a general practitioner (GP) clinic on 17 February.
As she had been identified as a contact of Case 66, she was referred by
MOH to NCID on 21 February. Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19
infection on 21 February afternoon.
10.                Prior to hospital admission, she had mostly stayed at
her home at Hougang Street 91.
Case 89
11.                Case 89 is a 41 year-old male Singapore Permanent
Resident who has no recent travel history to China. He was confirmed to
have COVID-19 infection on 22 February morning, and is currently warded
in an isolation room at NCID.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
12.                To date, a total of 49 cases have fully recovered
from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Of the 40
confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving.
Five are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.
UPDATE ON CONTACT TRACING FOR CONFIRMED CASES
13.                Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing.
Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a
precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their
last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts
who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.
14.                As of 22 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified
2,734 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 1,101 are
currently quarantined, and 1,633 have completed their quarantine.
HEALTH ADVISORY
15.                Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei
Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.
16.                All travellers should monitor their health closely
for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention
promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of
their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g.
cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic
ahead of the visit.
17.                Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating,

    after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory
    secretions after coughing or sneezing);

-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

18.                MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely.
As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore
is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
