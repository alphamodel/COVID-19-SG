A)  IMPORTED CASES: 1 (1 Permanent Resident)
There is 1 imported case today. Case 56496 is a Singapore Permanent
Resident who returned to Singapore from India on 13 August. She had been
placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and
was tested while she was serving SHN at a dedicated facility.
B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 30
Amongst the 30 cases residing in dormitories, 26 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 4 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with acute respiratory infection (ARI)
symptoms. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic
ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections.ยน The serological test results for 2 cases have come
back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.
2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH's daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.  Of the new cases, 94% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.  230 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 54,816 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.  There are currently 78 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 1,514 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
