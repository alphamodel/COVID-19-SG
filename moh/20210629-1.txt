Community Surveillance Testing At Henderson Road



COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE TESTING AT HENDERSON ROAD


Published Date: 29 Jun 2021

       The Ministry of Health (MOH) is investigating likely COVID-19
transmission at Henderson Road. So far, five cases of COVID-19 infection
have been detected in three households at 91
Henderson Road. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine
linkages and the source of transmission.



2. In order to disrupt any wider, undetected community
transmission, MOH will conduct mandatory COVID-19 testing for all
residents of 91 Henderson Road. Testing is optional for those who have
tested negative for COVID-19 infection from 25 June onwards. In the
event that a positive COVID-19 case is detected, MOH will isolate the
case, identify all close contacts, test and quarantine them to protect
the community from further transmission. Mandatory testing will be
conducted at the pavilion at 96B Henderson Road from 30 June to 1 July
2021 between 9am and 4pm.



3. To detect possible asymptomatic cases in the community, MOH
will also conduct voluntary COVID-19 testing for visitors and those who
have interacted with residents of 91 Henderson Road between 9 June and
28 June 2021. We encourage these individuals to come forward for
testing. Testing will be conducted by appointment only at designated
Regional Screening Centres from 30 June to 1 July 2021 and at the
pavilion at 96B Henderson Road on 1 July 2021, between 9am and 4pm.To
book an appointment and for information on the alternate test locations,
please visit https://go.gov.sg/91-hr-covid-19-testing or call 1800 333
9999 if you have any queries.



4. All residents are to bring along their NRIC for
identification purposes. Leaflets have been distributed and SMS
notifications have been sent to the residents to provide them with more
information. Residents are also advised to monitor their health closely
and consult a doctor immediately if they feel unwell. Those who are
still awaiting their test results are advised to minimise social
interactions as much as possible. They should continue to monitor their
health and seek immediate medical attention if they feel unwell.
