    <body><h1>Further Resumption of Activities for Seniors</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 09 Sep 2020</p> 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will be resuming more senior-centric activities carefully as community infection rates have remained generally low and stable. As more activities resume, we urge seniors to remain vigilant, conscientiously practise hand hygiene and safe distancing and to continue to keep to a small regular circle of contacts when going out.<br><br><strong>Resuming activities to address the psycho-social needs of seniors&nbsp;</strong><br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Small group activities of up to 5 pax may resume for senior-centric programmes organised by the People's Association, Health Promotion Board, Sport Singapore, and the Council for Third Age. They will also be allowed to resume in our eldercare facilities (i.e. Nursing Homes, Senior Care Centres, Active Ageing Hubs, Senior Activity Centres, Community Resource, Engagement and Support Team centres). Examples of group activities include board games and group exercise classes. At the start of Phase Two, we had limited activities in such settings to only those that can be done individually so as to keep interactions low. Nevertheless, group activities are an integral part of senior-centric programmes as they help address psychosocial needs and contribute to better health outcomes. From 9 September 2020, we will ease the earlier restrictions so that more seniors can benefit from these programmes, so long as safe distancing measures are in place.<br><br><strong>Outreach activities by eldercare programmes and Silver Generation Office to resume</strong><br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also resume proactive outreach by Silver Generation Ambassadors, Senior Activity Centres, Community Resource, Engagement and Support Teams and diabetes outreach activities from 9 September 2020 with safe distancing measures in place. While health and social care services are available, some seniors may not know where to seek help and may have deferred accessing community care services. This would affect their health if the deferment is prolonged. We will resume outreach programmes to ensure we can proactively engage seniors with care needs and render assistance in a timely manner.<br><br><strong>Staying safe and healthy in the new COVID-normal</strong><br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this COVID-19 pandemic, some seniors may be hesitant to go for medical appointments for fear of being exposed to COVID-19 at healthcare institutions or care facilities. To avoid potential deterioration of their medical conditions and allow for timely attention to other health needs, we urge seniors to continue to attend their medical appointments. Healthcare providers would have put in place the necessary precautions for patients to access services and receive treatments safely. Older patients in need of assistance may reach out to their respective public healthcare institutions or contact the AIC Hotline at 1800-650-6060.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to monitor the situation closely, with the aim of continuing to ease measures until we reach a new normal in Phase Three. We will be able to stay safe and progress towards a new normal so long as everyone plays their part and exercises social responsibility.</body>
