305 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 113 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 25 Jun 2020

  As of 25 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 113 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

A)  IMPORTED CASES: 0

There are no imported cases today.

B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 5 (1 Singaporean, 2 Work Pass
holders, 2 Work Permit holders)

Of the 5 cases in the community, 2 had been picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 2 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier.

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the Singaporean case
(Case 42761), who had been tested when he sought medical treatment.

All 4 Work Pass/ Work Permit holders were tested even though they are
asymptomatic. Amongst them, 2 (Cases 42669 and 42684) had been
identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had already
been quarantined at government quarantine facilities. They were swabbed
during quarantine to verify their status. The remaining 2 cases (Cases
42731 and 42732) were tested as part of our efforts to screen workers in
essential services.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections.[1] The serological test results for four of today’s
cases (Cases 42669, 42684, 42731 and 42732) have come back positive,
which indicate likely past infection.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 7 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 2 per day in the past two weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.

C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 108

We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.  Of the new cases, 96% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

4.  In the past week (18 June to 24 June), MOH has uncovered
links for 8 previously unlinked cases.

5.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

6.  305 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 36,604 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

7.  There are currently 189 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 5,917 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 26 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.



MINISTRY OF HEALTH
25 JUNE 2020

[1]  Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a
past infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
