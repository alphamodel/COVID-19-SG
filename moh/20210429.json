She also periodically helps out at a food stall at The Summit located at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Bukit Timah campus. </p><p>She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she was tested on 26 April as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). An individual test was done on 27 April, and her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection. Her earlier tests from RRT \u2013 the last being on 14 April \u2013 were all negative for COVID-19 infection. Her serology test result has come back positive but we have assessed that this is likely a recent infection.<br></p><p>Case 62553 received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 27 January, and the second dose on 19 February. The COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those vaccinated, but it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get infected.</p><p><strong>Case 62541 Cluster</strong></p><p>8 more cases are linked to Case 62541 [1], with a total of 9 cases detected so far in the cluster. Of these, 3 are Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) staff, and 6 are patients who were warded in Ward 9D. Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing. In the meantime, we have put in place precautionary measures to ringfence the cases. </p><p><u>Case 62557</u><br></p><p>Case 62557 is a 30 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who is a doctor at TTSH. He had attended to patients in Ward 9D but had not gone to work after onset of symptoms.</p><p>He developed a fever on 27 April and sore throat the next day, and sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner clinic on 27 April, where he was tested for COVID-19. His test result came back positive the next day, and he was conveyed to NCID in an ambulance. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Case 62557 received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18 January, and the second dose on 8 February.</p><p><u>Case 62599</u></p><p>Case 62599 is an 18 year-old female Singaporean who is a healthcare assistant trainee at TTSH, and was deployed at Ward 9D. She is asymptomatic and was detected on 28 April as part of TTSH\u2019s proactive testing of patients and staff in Ward 9D following the confirmation of Case 62541. Her test came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day, and she was conveyed to NCID in an ambulance. Her serological test result has come back negative.</p><p><u>Case 62561</u></p><p>Case 62561 is a 57 year-old male Singaporean who is a patient at TTSH, and was initially warded in Ward 7D, before being transferred to Ward 9D.</p><p>He developed a fever on 16 April but did not seek medical treatment. On 18 April, as his fever persisted, and he had developed a runny nose and cough, he sought treatment at TTSH\u2019s emergency department. He was tested for COVID-19 infection and his test result was negative. He was subsequently warded in Ward 7D. On 20 April, he was transferred to Ward 9D. As he had persistent fever, he was reviewed by an infectious diseases physician, and transferred to an isolation ward on 27 April. On 28 April, he tested positive for COVID-19 infection and was transferred to NCID. His serological test result has come back negative.</p><p><u>Cases 62567, 62568, 62573, 62574 and 62582</u></p><p>Cases 62567, 62568, 62573, 62574 and 62582 are patients warded at TTSH\u2019s Ward 9D, and were detected as part of TTSH\u2019s proactive testing of patients in Ward 9D. Amongst them, 3 are asymptomatic, while Cases 62567 and 62568 developed fever and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms on 25 April and 28 April respectively.</p><p><u>Lockdown of TTSH wards and other precautionary measures.&nbsp;</u></p><p>TTSH has locked down both Ward 7D and Ward 9D. Testing for staff and patients who have been in both wards is still in progress. All close contacts of the cases, including patients, visitors and staff who have been in the affected wards, will also be placed on quarantine.</p><p>TTSH has stepped up clinical surveillance of all inpatients who may develop fever and ARI symptoms. As a precautionary measure, all patients and staff in other TTSH wards will also be tested for COVID-19 infection, including those who are asymptomatic. This additional testing will enable us to draw out any hidden links. Our strategy is to aggressively test and draw a wide ring around the cases, to try and prevent further spread.</p><p>TTSH has also taken additional steps to minimise the risks of transmission. Staff and patient movement in all the main wards has been minimised to prevent any cross-infection. From 29 April, no visitors will be allowed into the hospital except for critically ill patients. During this period, elective cases will be deferred except for those that are urgent, and A&amp;E cases that are non-life-threatening will be redirected to other hospitals.</p><p><strong>Case 62517 Cluster</strong></p><p>7 more cases are linked to the Case 62517 [2]&nbsp;cluster.
