5       Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6      13 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,816 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7      There are currently 15 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 65 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
8      A 64 year-old male Singaporean has passed away from complications
due to COVID-19 infection on 26 February 2021. He had been residing in
Indonesia from 17 March 2020, and had a past history of hyperlipidaemia.
He tested positive for COVID-19 infection on 26 January 2021 while he
was in Indonesia, and was hospitalised there on 27 January. He was
subsequently medically evacuated to the National Centre for Infectious
Diseases (NCID) for treatment on 29 January, and his test taken in
Singapore on 30 January also came back positive for COVID-19. NCID has
reached out to his family and is extending assistance to them. As he was
already an overseas registered case, he was not included in Singapore’s
COVID-19 case count.
