157 More Cases Discharged 277 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed



157 MORE CASES DISCHARGED 277 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 24 Jul 2020

           As of 24 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 277 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A)    IMPORTED CASES: 2 (2 Dependant’s Pass holders)
Both imported cases are Dependant’s Pass holders who returned to
Singapore from India on 12 July. They had been placed on 14-day
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested
while serving their SHN.

B)    CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3 [1]  (3 Work Permit holders)
Of the 3 cases in the community, 2 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine. 1 case is asymptomatic, and was detected through our
proactive testing.

2 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters.
1 (Case 49453) had been identified as a contact of a previously
confirmed case, and was tested when he became symptomatic shortly after
being identified as a close contact. The remaining case (Case 49440) was
detected as part of our proactive case finding of individuals working at
a newly emergent workplace cluster.

1 community case is currently unlinked. Case 49439 was identified from
our proactive screening of workers in essential services who are living
outside the dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections.[2] The serological test results for Cases 49439 and
49440 have come back positive, which indicate likely past infections.
Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked case are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for his household contacts to determine if he
could have been infected by them.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 11 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 8 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 6 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 4 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

C)    CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 272

We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.

2.             Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.             Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while
the rest are pending contact tracing.
4.             The Inter-Agency Task Force has been systematically and
progressively clearing dormitories through aggressive testing of migrant
workers residing in dormitories. Cochrane Lodge I (51 Admiralty Road
West) has been cleared, and now houses only recovered individuals and
those who have recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As such,
the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.             In the past week (17 July to 23 July), MOH has uncovered
links for 4 previously unlinked cases in the community.
6.             Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
Please refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.             157 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 45,172 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.
8.             There are currently 157 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 4,019 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
MINISTRY OF HEALTH
24 JULY 2020
[1] Updated from the afternoon press release as two cases have been
re-classified following contact tracing.
[2] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
