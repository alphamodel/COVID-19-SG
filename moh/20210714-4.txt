Published Date: 14 Jul 2021

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the global
COVID-19 situation and regularly reviews Singapore’s border measures to
manage the risk of importation from travellers and onward local
transmission, taking into account the current situation in their source
countries/ regions.
RESTRICTING TRAVEL FROM MYANMAR
2. Given the worsening situation, we will tighten our border measures
for travellers from Myanmar. From 15 JULY 2021, 2359 HOURS, until
further notice, aLL LONG-TERM PASS HOLDERS AND SHORT-TERM VISITORS WITH
RECENT TRAVEL HISTORY (INCLUDING TRANSIT) TO MYANMAR WITHIN THE LAST 21
DAYS WILL NOT BE ALLOWED ENTRY INTO SINGAPORE, OR TRANSIT THROUGH
SINGAPORE. This will also apply to all those who had obtained prior
approval for entry into Singapore. With effect from 15 July 2021, 2359
hours, all travellers with recent travel history to Myanmar will also be
subject to an on-arrival Antigen Rapid Test (ART)¹.
3. All travellers with recent travel history to Myanmar who have yet to
complete their 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) by 15 JULY 2021, 2359HRS
will continue to be subjected to:
a. 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities; and
b. On-arrival polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test², self-administered
ART test on Day 3, 7 and 11 of arrival, and PCR test on Day 14 of
arrival.
REGULAR REVIEW OF BORDER MEASURES
4. As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our
border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to
the community with changes updated on the SafeTravel website. The
Ministry of Health will also continue to review the data and evidence on
any new viral strains and update the measures accordingly.
