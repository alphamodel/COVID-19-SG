Upon his return to Singapore, he served SHN at a dedicated facility until 7 February. His test taken on 6 February during SHN was negative for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 19 April in preparation for a trip. His test result came back positive the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.&nbsp;<br><br>His Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and his serology test result has come back positive. He could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection which are no longer transmissible and infective to others, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude when he had been infected, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0<br></strong><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 14<br></strong><br>Amongst the 14 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br></span></p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2 (Cases 62196 and 62207) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2 (Cases 62197 and 62201) are Dependant\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from India and the UAE.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1 (Case 62193) is a Student\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from India.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">7 (Cases 62194, 62195, 62199, 62202, 62206, 62209 and 62219) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India, Luxembourg, Nepal, the Netherlands, UAE and UK.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1 (Case 62221) is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Indonesia and is a foreign domestic worker.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" aria-level=\"1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1 (Case 62198) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from India to visit his family member who is a Singaporean. </span></p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><br>They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annexes-(4).pdf?sfvrsn=78d246f2_0\" title=\"Annexes \">Annexes </a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;36 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
