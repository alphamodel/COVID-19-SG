They were also asking for memos from the hospital to certify that the workers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was concerned that this would trigger a flood of healthy workers being sent to A&amp;E departments, distracting them from the care and treatment of ill patients who required their attention. On 12 February 2020, MOH, MOM and other agencies jointly issued an advisory to the industry to advise that there was no need to prevent workers who were residing in the dormitory from working if they were not unwell. </span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 8pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">6<span>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Subsequently, the hospitals informed MOH that employers were still sending workers who were healthy for testing. MOH then informed MOM, and a further advisory was sent out on 19 February 2020 to advise employers not to send their workers who were healthy for testing, so as to ensure that medical facilities and resources were focused on unwell individuals who needed medical treatment. This advice was based on the prevailing scientific evidence at that time and was also in line with MOH\u2019s risk-based approach to prioritise testing and care for those who were of high risk.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">7<span>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">In the advisories to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring their workers for testing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers.
