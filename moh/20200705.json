&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>These statements are false. </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">The Multi-Ministry Taskforce, led by the Ministers and staffed by senior public officials and medical professionals, was set up in January 2020 to direct the national whole-of-government response to COVID-19 and to ensure smooth coordination across Ministries and all affected sectors. </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">The medical management of migrant workers was guided by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and its medical professionals, based on the prevailing scientific evidence and local situation.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 8pt;

font-size: 16px;\">5<span>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">On 8 February 2020, Changi General Hospital (CGH) informed MOH that an employer in the construction industry was sending all his workers to the CGH A&amp;E Department to be tested for COVID-19 though the workers exhibited no symptoms and were well. They were also asking for memos from the hospital to certify that the workers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was concerned that this would trigger a flood of healthy workers being sent to A&amp;E departments, distracting them from the care and treatment of ill patients who required their attention. On 12 February 2020, MOH, MOM and other agencies jointly issued an advisory to the industry to advise that there was no need to prevent workers who were residing in the dormitory from working if they were not unwell. </span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 8pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">6<span>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Subsequently, the hospitals informed MOH that employers were still sending workers who were healthy for testing. MOH then informed MOM, and a further advisory was sent out on 19 February 2020 to advise employers not to send their workers who were healthy for testing, so as to ensure that medical facilities and resources were focused on unwell individuals who needed medical treatment. This advice was based on the prevailing scientific evidence at that time and was also in line with MOH\u2019s risk-based approach to prioritise testing and care for those who were of high risk.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">7<span>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">In the advisories to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring their workers for testing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers. What MOM said was: \u201cDo not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the worker needs to be sent to the hospital.\u201d</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The same advice was given to all in Singapore, citizens as well as residents: If unwell, even with mild respiratory symptoms, see a general practitioner immediately, who will decide on the course of treatment. </span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Multi-Ministry Taskforce and government agencies will continue to take proactive measures to ensure the well-being of our migrant workers and safeguard the health of the general public.</span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><strong>For more information</strong></span></p> <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><span>10.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>For details on the corrections and clarifications regarding the misleading false statements of facts, please refer to </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><a href=\"http://www.gov.sg/article/factually050720a\">www.gov.sg/article/factually050720a</a></span></p> <div><br clear=\"all\"> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"> <div id=\"ftn1\"> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><font face=\"Times New Roman\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.3333px;\">[1]&nbsp;</span></font><span style=\"font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">A Correction Direction is a Direction issued to a person who has communicated a falsehood (i.e. the recipient) that affects the public interest.
