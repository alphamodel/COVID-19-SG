Second Covid-19 Vaccine Authorised for Use In Singapore



SECOND COVID-19 VACCINE AUTHORISED FOR USE IN SINGAPORE


Published Date: 03 Feb 2021

       The government welcomes the Expert Committee on COVID-19
Vaccination’s endorsement of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for use in
Singapore in individuals aged 18 years and above. This follows the
Health Sciences Authority’s (HSA) authorisation of the vaccine under the
Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). The  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is
the second COVID-19 vaccine to be authorised for pandemic use by HSA,
after the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
2.   We will progressively roll out the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for
individuals aged 18 years and above when shipments of the vaccine
arrive. We expect the first shipment to arrive around March 2021, if
there are no disruptions to the shipment schedule.
3.   More vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive
over the course of the year. We will continue to monitor our supplies
closely to ensure that we will have enough vaccines for all Singaporeans
and long-term residents in Singapore by the third quarter of 2021.
4.    As of 2 February 2021, more than 175,000 individuals have received
their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. About 6,000 of them have also
received their second dose of the vaccine, and completed the full
vaccination regimen. In two weeks’ time, they will be adequately
protected against COVID-19.
5.   Vaccination is critical to protect us and our loved ones against
COVID-19. Vaccination also protects those in our community who cannot be
vaccinated due to medical reasons. While COVID-19 vaccination will be
voluntary, we strongly encourage everyone who is medically eligible for
vaccination to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered, to better
protect ourselves and our loved ones.
