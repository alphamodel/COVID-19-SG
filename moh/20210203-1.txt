CASE DETAILS

A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
Case 59935 is a 35 year-old female Indian national who is a Long-Term
Visit Pass holder. She travelled to India from 30 November 2020 and
returned to Singapore on 6 January 2021. Her pre-departure test taken in
India on 4 January before her flight was negative for COVID-19. Upon her
return, she served SHN at a dedicated facility until 20 January. Her
swab done on 17 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19.
She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 2 February in preparation for another trip to
India. Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was
conveyed to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital in an ambulance.
We have classified this case as locally transmitted while her serology
test result is pending. Should her serology test come back positive, and
epidemiological investigations assess that this is a past infection, we
will reclassify this as an imported case. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including her family members,
have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the
start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close
contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 17
Amongst the 17 imported cases,
