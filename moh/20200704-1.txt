    As of 4 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed
and verified an additional 185 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore.
The breakdown is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 1 (1 Permanent Resident)
There is an imported case today involving a Singapore Permanent Resident
who had returned to Singapore from India on 21 June 2020, and is a
family member of Case 44351. He was placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN)
upon arrival in Singapore, and had been conveyed in a dedicated
transport to an SHN facility to commence his 14-day isolation. He is
asymptomatic, and had been tested while serving SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 9 (4 Singaporeans, 3 Work Pass holders, 2
Work Permit holders)
Of the 9 cases in the community, 4 had been picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier.
1 of the community cases today is linked to a previous case. Case 44700
had been identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and had
already been quarantined earlier. He is asymptomatic and was tested
during quarantine to verify his status.
8 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 3 cases
(Cases 44630, 44631 and 44633) were proactively swabbed as they work in
essential services, even though 2 are asymptomatic. Another case (Case
44596) was detected as part of our proactive screening of individuals
deployed to frontline COVID-19 operations. Epidemiological
investigations are ongoing for the remaining 4 cases (Cases 44518,
44562, 44591 and 44680), 3 of whom had been tested under our enhanced
community testing after being diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 6 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 9 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 3 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 5 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 175
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex

3.     Of the new cases, 95% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.     We announced on 2 July that MOH has placed 58 households residing
at Block 111 Tampines Street 11 under active phone surveillance and
would be facilitating COVID-19 testing for them and their visitors. This
is a precautionary measure after MOH had detected 9 confirmed cases from
2 households residing at the block. In total, 116 residents and visitors
have been tested, and all the results have come back negative for
COVID-19. MOH will continue to closely monitor the situation.
