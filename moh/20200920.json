Another case (Case 57706) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from Iran on 15 September and the remaining case (Case 57707) is a Student\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from Germany on 9 September. <br><br>All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cases in the community: 1</strong> (1 Work Permit holder)<br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 57718 was detected from our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic. <br><br>Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the meantime, all his identified close contacts have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for his household contacts to determine if he could have been infected by them.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cases residing in dormitories: 13&nbsp;<br><br></strong>Amongst the 13 cases residing in dormitories, 5 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;<strong><br><br></strong>The remaining 8 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts. <br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
