2.     Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained
low, with a total of 2 cases in the past week. Both cases are currently
unlinked. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as
the cases detected through our surveillance programme.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
58262 was last at work as a cleaner on 2 November. He developed symptoms
a day later, and sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner
clinic, where he was tested for COVID-19 under our enhanced community
testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with
ARI at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify
infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today. He was detected through
our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories.
This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so
that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts. His serological test result has come back positive,
which indicates likely past infection.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 7
Amongst the 7 imported cases, 1 (Case 58257) is a Singaporean and
another (Case 58258) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from
Uzbekistan and Indonesia respectively. Another 2 (Cases 58259 and 58260)
are Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from
Indonesia. The next case (Case 58261) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who
arrived from the UAE. The remaining cases are Short-Term Visit Pass
holders. Case 58252 is on a work project in Singapore while Case 58253’s
spouse is a Singaporean.
They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.
3.   Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.        4 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,985 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.       There are currently 40 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 20 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
