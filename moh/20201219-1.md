In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.

The cases, who were confirmed between 2 November and 11 November to have COVID-19 infection, were observed to have high genetic similarity despite having arrived from different countries. From MOH’s preliminary investigations, we cannot exclude that transmissions could have occurred at Mandarin Orchard Singapore.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all guests, the hotel has stopped accepting new guests and is checking out existing guests progressively.
