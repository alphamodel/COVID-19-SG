    <body><h1>Investigations Into 13 Covid-19 Cases Who Served Shn At Mandarin Orchard Singapore</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 19 Dec 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: black;">1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Ministry of Health (MOH) is investigating 13 cases of COVID-19 infection amongst individuals who had served Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at Mandarin Orchard Singapore (333 Orchard Road)</span></span><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;"><span>.</span></span><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;"><span> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">As a precautionary measure, Mandarin Orchard Singapore will stop accepting new guests with immediate effect. Those currently serving SHN at the hotel will be moved to another SHN dedicated facility. The hotel has made arrangements to check out existing guests progressively. Restaurant and event spaces within the hotel will also be closed.</span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As part of routine laboratory surveillance, the National Public Health Laboratory conducts whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis on all COVID-19 cases. It takes about four weeks to culture the virus and complete the genome sequencing. 13 imported cases, who were confirmed between 2 November and 11 November to have COVID-19 infection, were observed to have high genetic similarity despite the cases having arrived from different countries, including Bahrain, Canada, Indonesia, Myanmar, Netherlands, Philippines, South Korea, UAE, UK and US. This suggests that these cases were likely infected from a similar source. Further investigations by MOH found that these 13 cases [1]</span><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;"> had served SHN at </span><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">Mandarin Orchard Singapore</span><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;"> between 22 October and 11 November 2020. Genome sequencing and analysis are continuing for cases beyond 11 November. [2]<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">Epidemiological investigations were immediately initiated to determine if there is a potential link between these 13 cases, and to study if transmission could have occurred locally, and not from their country of origin. From MOHâ€™s preliminary investigations, we cannot exclude that transmissions could have occurred at </span><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">Mandarin Orchard Singapore</span><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">Persons on SHN are housed in a dedicated tower and floors at the hotel, segregated from all other guests, with no interaction amongst them. However as a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all guests in the hotel, the hotel will check out all its occupants. Persons serving SHN will be transported via dedicated vehicles to an alternative SHN dedicated facility. Deep cleaning and disinfection will be carried out by the hotel, in consultation with MOH and the National Environment Agency.<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">MOH has commenced a special testing operations to test around 500 staff of the hotel for COVID-19 infection. These include both staff serving those on SHN, and those who serve other guests in other parts of the hotel. We will also test all who are currently serving SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore for COVID-19 infection to determine their status, instead of waiting till their SHN exit swab.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">Guests who have stayed at Mandarin Orchard Singapore between 11 November and 19 December are advised to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their last date of stay. They should see a doctor promptly if they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose), as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">Hotels used as SHN dedicated facilities must have in place strict protocols to segregate persons on SHN from all other guests. These include placing persons on SHN in segregated blocks, wings or floors, and ensuring their route of movement is clearly demarcated from other guests. Persons on SHN are also not allowed to leave their rooms during their stay, and rooms are thoroughly disinfected and sanitised upon completion of SHN according to strict infection control measures. They will also not be allowed access to common facilities in the hotels. The Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore Police Force conduct regular checks on these hotels to ensure that safe management measures are complied with, and that security measures are in place. The Government takes a serious view of any breach in protocols and will investigate and take actions should there be non-compliance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;"><br clear="all"> </span></p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"> <div id="ftn1"> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">[1] Cases 58204, 58235, 58233, 58236, 58237, 58234, 58244, 58245, 58253, 58252, 58268, 58281 and 58284.
