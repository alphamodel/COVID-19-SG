* Please refer to Annex A for the affected markets and food centres
_Closure of Clementi 448 Market & Food Centre and Whampoa Drive Market _
7.    MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving markets
and food centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who visited
Jurong Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the markets and
food centres. We have detected 22 cases amongst individuals who worked
in or visited Clementi 448 Market & Food Centre, and 12 cases at Whampoa
Drive Market. To break the chain of transmission and enable deep
cleaning of the premises, Clementi 448 Market & Food Centre (448
Clementi Avenue 3) and Whampoa Drive Market (92 Whampoa Drive) will be
closed to all members of the public from 22 July to 5 August 2021.
_Community surveillance testing for visitors to selected markets & food
centres_
8.    To uncover any community infection cases, we will extend free
COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited the following
premises between 7 July and 21 July:

-   Clementi 448 Market & Food Centre; and
-   Haig Road Market & Food Centre.

Please refer to https://go.gov.sg/mbs-mkt-testing for details on the
testing operations.
_Collection of ART self-test kits for visitors to selected markets and
food centres
_
9.    As an added layer of ringfencing to help to identify cases and
prevent further transmission, MOH is working with the People’s
Association to distribute antigen rapid test (ART) self-test kits to
individuals who had visited selected markets and food centres in the
last 14 days, such as residents living in the vicinity of these centres.
The collection will run from 22 to 23 July 2021 at Residents’ Committee
Centres in the vicinity of the following locations:

-   Whampoa Drive Market (92 Whampoa Drive); and
-   726 West Coast Market (726 West Coast Road).

10.    Eligible persons are strongly encouraged to collect and perform
self-testing using these ART kits. Please refer to
https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/art to check on the nearest Residents’
Committee Centre for self-collection.

_Closure of Marina Bay Sands Casino_
11.    MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
individuals who worked in or visited Marina Bay Sands Casino. To date,
we have detected 11 cases linked to the cluster, and our epidemiological
investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at
the Casino. To break the chain of transmission and enable deep cleaning
of the premises, Marina Bay Sands Casino will be closed to all members
of the public from 22 July to 5 August 2021.
12.    To quickly uncover any community infection cases, we are
conducting special testing operations for all staff of the Casino. We
will also extend free COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had
visited Marina Bay Sands Casino between 7 July and 21 July 2021. Please
refer to https://go.gov.sg/mbs-mkt-testing for details on the testing
operations.

Ongoing transmission at KTV clubs/lounges_
13.    MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst social
hostesses who had frequented KTV lounges or clubs currently operating as
F&B outlets, and their close social contacts. Our epidemiological
investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at
Sakura Entertainment (517 Geylang Road).
14.    All visitors to the affected premises are advised to monitor
their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as
possible, for 14 days from their date of visit or interaction. They are
encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell. We also
advise all visitors to markets and food centres to avoid crowds and to
do your marketing during off-peak hours, or at supermarkets, and to
strictly observe the safe management measures.
CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
15.    379 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 7 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 1 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU). None amongst these 8 cases is fully
vaccinated. 2 seniors above 60 years, one completely unvaccinated, and
one partially vaccinated, have fallen very ill.

Supplementation, by Age Group
[Figure09_21Jul]
16.    There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 8 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 6 are unvaccinated, 2 are partially vaccinated and none was fully
vaccinated.
