away from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 21 August 2021. Her
case was first reported on 3 August. She had developed symptoms on 30
July, was tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and was admitted to

8.    There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 8.6%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 1.7%.
