Another case (Case 58040) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who was allowed entry into Singapore to visit a family member who is hospitalised here. The remaining 2 cases are a Training Employment Pass holder (Case 58041) who arrived from India, and a Student\u2019s Pass holder (Case 58039) who arrived from France.

He was tested on 5 October while serving SHN and his test result was negative for COVID-19. He completed his SHN on 9 October and developed onset of symptoms on the same day. He subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 infection on 12 October when he took a pre-departure test in order to return to India.

In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at Mandai Lodge I (460 Mandai Road) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
