    <body><h1>Expert Committee On Covid-19 Vaccination Endorses Use of Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 03 Feb 2021</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Press Release by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination<br></strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination welcomes the interim authorisation of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), for use in Singapore in individuals aged 18 years and above to prevent COVID-19 disease.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Expert Committee has independently reviewed the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine’s safety and efficacy data for different population segments in Singapore, and has been briefed by HSA on its full range of considerations in granting interim authorisation, and is satisfied with its safety and efficacy.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In assessing the suitability of vaccine candidates for specific population groups, the Expert Committee took into consideration the safety, efficacy and tolerability of the vaccine and data adequacy of clinical trials. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated a high vaccine efficacy of 94%, and its safety profile is consistent with the standards set for other registered vaccines used in the immunisation against other diseases.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We endorse HSA’s recommendation of the suitability of use in individuals aged 18 years and above in Singapore. However, pregnant women, severely immuno-compromised persons and those under the age of 18 should not receive the vaccine yet, until more safety and efficacy data become available. Persons with a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergies should also not be given the vaccine at this time.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Expert Committee will continue to monitor and review the use of COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore as more data becomes available over time. While Singapore currently has a low rate of local transmission of COVID-19, we remain at risk of a surge in cases. Therefore it is important that we achieve as comprehensive a coverage of COVID-19 vaccination as possible across the entire population. We strongly encourage all persons who are medically eligible to be vaccinated when the vaccine is made available to them.<br><br><br><strong>EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION&nbsp;<br>3 FEBRUARY 2021</strong></span></span></p></body>
