Based on our investigations so far, there are 4 cases in the community, all of whom are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 10 imported cases, who had all been placed on Stay-Home Notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore.&nbsp;<br></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst the 80 cases residing in dormitories today, 58 are from Sungei Tengah Lodge, who had all been placed on quarantine earlier. The vast majority of them were tested during quarantine to determine their status, or picked up through Rostered Routine Testing. Following the detection of cases at Sungei Tengah Lodge, we had placed about 4,500 workers on quarantine, and tested about 3,000 of them so far.
