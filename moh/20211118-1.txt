Smoking Rates Down, Chronic Disease Prevalence Remains of Concern



SMOKING RATES DOWN, CHRONIC DISEASE PREVALENCE REMAINS OF CONCERN


Published Date: 18 Nov 2021

_National Population Health Survey 2020 findings highlight need to
tackle unhealthy lifestyle habits_
1.     The National Population Health Survey (NPHS) report 2020, which
tracks the health and risk factors, as well as lifestyle practices of
Singapore residents¹ for the period of July 2019 to March 2020², has
found that smoking prevalence has fallen, and screening for colorectal
and breast cancer has increased. However, the Survey has highlighted
some areas of concern, including the rising prevalence of hypertension
and hyperlipidaemia, higher body mass index (BMI) and overall lower
physical activity.
2.     The results of the NPHS are a reminder for Singaporeans to
continue engaging in healthy lifestyle habits amidst the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Health Promotion
Board (HPB) will continue to support Singaporeans to stay healthy. We
encourage Singaporeans to take ownership of your health and play your
part in leading a healthier lifestyle.
RESULTS OF NPHS 2020
_Chronic disease continues to be a concern_
3.     The prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia showed an
increasing trend over the years. During the period of 2019 to 2020, over
one in three (35.5%) had hypertension, and about four in 10 (39.1%) had
hyperlipidaemia (or high blood cholesterol) compared to about one in
four (24.2%) and slightly more than one in three (35.5%) in
2017respectively. The increasing trend was observed even after adjusting
for the possible effect of an ageing population³. The increase in
prevalence for both conditions was greatest among those 40 years and
above. While the crude prevalence of diabetes showed a slight increase
from 8.8% in 2017 to 9.5%for the period of 2019 to 2020, a stable trend
was seen after adjusting for age⁴.
_More were obese or had high risk BMI, and fewer engaged in sufficient
total physical activity_
4.     During the period of 2019 to 2020, over one in 10 (10.5%)
Singapore residents were obese⁵ and over two in 10 (20.7%) had high risk
BMI⁶. This is a slight increase from 2017⁷.The prevalence of obesity and
high risk BMI was more common among adults aged 30 to 59 years, almost
double that of those aged 18 to 29 years.
5.     From the survey, fewer Singapore residents were engaged in at
least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week⁸ in
2020 (76.4%)⁹, compared to 2017 (80.9%), despite the increase in the
number of Singapore residents engaging in leisure-time regular
exercise¹⁰ in 2020 (33.4%) compared to 2017 (29.4%). Similar trends were
also observed after adjusting for age¹¹.
_Smoking prevalence continues to decrease while binge drinking has
increased
_
6.     Smoking prevalence has seen a steady decline over the past
decade. The NPHS results showed that smoking prevalence for Singapore
residents has decreased to 10.1% in 2020, from 11.8% in 2017.
7.     However, the crude prevalence of binge drinking¹² has increased
in 2020 (10.5%), compared to 2017 (8.8%). This increase was seen mainly
in the younger age groups, particularly among individuals aged 18 to 29
years and 30 to 39 years.
_Slight decrease in chronic disease screening rates while screening for
colorectal cancer and breast cancer increased_
8.     In 2020, 63% of Singapore residents aged 40 to 74 years with no
previous diagnosis of diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood
cholesterol were screened for all three health conditions within the
recommended frequency. This was a slight decrease from 66.4% in 2017.
9.     Screening rates for colorectal cancer increased in 2020 (41.1%),
compared to 2017 (35.0%). Similarly, screening rates of breast cancer
screening increased in 2020 (37.9%) compared to 2017 (30.9%). Screening
rates for cervical cancer remained stable in 2020 (45.4%) compared to
2017 (46.3%).
_Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccination Coverage has increased_
10.     Influenza vaccination¹³ coverage among Singapore residents aged
18 to 74 years showed an increase from 13.1% in 2017 to 17.0% in 2020.
While vaccination rates increased across all age groups, adults aged 18
to 29 years and 60 to 74 years had the highest influenza vaccination
coverage compared to other age groups.
11.     Similarly, Pneumococcal vaccination¹⁴ coverage among elderly
aged 65 to 74 years increased from 11.9% in 2017 to 14.4% in 2020.
_Prevalence of poor mental health remained stable_
12.     The crude prevalence of poor mental health¹⁵ among Singapore
residents remained stable in 2020 (13.4%) compared to 2017 (12.5%). A
similar trend was observed for age adjusted prevalence¹⁶. Younger adults
aged 18 to 29 years had the highest proportion (21.5%) with poor mental
health while the prevalence for other age groups were lower.
FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT PRESSING NEED FOR ACTION
13.     The NPHS 2020 findings highlight the need to build upon our
ongoing health promotion efforts while moving ahead to innovate new ways
to empower the population to take charge of their health, especially as
Singaporeans' behaviours may have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We will continue to press on in the following areas:
a) Encouraging Singaporeans to increase physical activity and adopt a
heathier diet
14.     An observed increase in prevalence in obesity and high risk BMI
can potentially increase the risk of developing chronic diseases. Aside
from genetic factors, obesity can also result from a lack of physical
activity and an unhealthy diet. To encourage Singaporeans to be more
active, we will continue to improve accessibility to our regular
exercise programmes, such as bringing the programmes online and creating
more exercise sessions in available community spaces. We will also
encourage Singaporeans to lead more active lifestyles through
population-wide programmes such as the National Steps Challenge.
15.     With the increase in hypertension prevalence, we need to do more
to reduce sodium consumption in our diets. Salt is the primary source of
sodium, and high sodium intake is associated with increased risk of
hypertension. Singapore residents are consuming3,600mg of sodium per day
on average in 2018,higher than before¹⁷, and 9 in 10 Singapore residents
exceeded the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendation to consume
less than 2,000mg of sodium per day (i.e. no more than 1 teaspoon of
regular salt). To address this issue, HPB is planning to ramp up
existing efforts to spur reformulation of reduced-sodium sauces and
seasonings, and embark on a nationwide campaign to encourage
Singaporeans to reduce sodium consumption in their diets. More details
will be released in the coming months.
16.     To promote healthier diets, we also need to do more to reduce
our sugar intake. To help Singaporeans reduce their sugar intake from
beverages and spur industry reformulation, we announced in October 2019
that we would be introducing mandatory nutrition labels, also known as
‘Nutri-Grade’, and advertising prohibitions on pre-packaged
non-alcoholic beverages sold in Singapore. These measures will come into
effect from Q4 2022 onwards to allow the industry more time to comply
with the measures and reformulate their products given disruptions
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also working on extending these
measures to freshly prepared beverages, which is a key and growing
source of sugar in our diets. More information will be made available in
the coming months.
17.     These efforts will work in tandem with other ongoing efforts
such as the Healthier Choice Symbol, Healthier Dining Programme and Eat,
Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge to create an ecosystem to support
individuals in making healthier food choices.
b) Efforts targeted at smoking and binge drinking will continue
18.     While we have seen a reduction in smoking prevalence, we will
continue our efforts to keep smoking prevalence low. We will be
enhancing our educational efforts in mainstream schools to prevent
smoking initiation from young while continuing to help smokers quit
through our smoking cessation programmes. In addition to our programmes,
policies such as Minimum Legal Age 21 and standardised packaging for all
tobacco products form part of a multi-pronged approach to tobacco
control, which aim to reduce smoking among our youth and young adults.
19.     To target binge drinking, we will continue our educational
efforts in mainstream schools and Institutes of Higher Learning on the
harmful effects of alcohol consumption while continuing collaborations
with industry partners to include pertinent messages on responsible
drinking in their campaigns.
c) Encouraging early detection through regular screening
20.     It is important to go for regular, recommended health screening
for early detection of diseases so as to enable early intervention. As
part of Screen for Life (SFL) programme, eligible Singapore residents
are offered heavily subsidised screening tests for cardiovascular risk
factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia), cervical
cancer and colorectal cancer at no more than $5 for the screening tests,
screening visit and first follow-up consultation (if required).We will
continue our efforts to reach out to the unscreened population, to
encourage Singaporeans to participate in screening regularly.
d) Encouraging vaccination uptake
21.     Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination is recommended in the
National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS) to prevent serious
complications and death among high risk groups such as the elderly and
persons with certain medical conditions. The increase in uptake is
promising. All persons who have been recommended to receive the
vaccination should take it up to protect themselves. To encourage
further uptake, since November 2020, subsidies have been extended to
these vaccination as recommended under the NAIS for eligible Singaporean
adults, and made more accessible through CHAS GP clinics as well as
polyclinics. In partnership with healthcare professionals, HPB and other
stakeholders, we will continue to reach out and promote the uptake of
influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among these groups.
e) Supporting better mental health and wellbeing
22.     Taking into consideration the increased stress and worry that
the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, there is a greater need to improve the
population’s mental wellbeing and foster a conducive environment for
support. The COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce (CoMWT) has made
recommendations to develop a national mental health and well-being
strategy, a national mental health resource portal to help individuals
access useful and accurate information, and a national mental health
competency training framework to align and standardise training
curriculums on mental health in the community. These recommendations
will be implemented under the new Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health
and Well-being. In addition, HPB continues to offer mental wellness
programmes at schools, workplaces and community, aimed at helping
Singaporeans cope with challenges faced in the new normal
23.     To further address the concerns of youth mental health issues,
the Youth Mental Well-being Network was formed in February 2020 and
brought together over 1,500 passionate like-minded individuals including
mental health professionals, practitioners, parents and youths, to work
on projects to support youth mental health. The Network is supported by
the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), MOH and the
Ministry of Education (MOE). In addition, MOH and the Agency for
Integrated Care(AIC), together with community partners, have set up
youth community outreach teams to reach out to youths in mental distress
to provide basic emotional support and resources, and link them with
social and health services.
LET’S TAKE CHARGE OF OUR HEALTH
24.     As we adjust to living with COVID-19, MOH and HPB will continue
to working closely with various agencies to create an ecosystem that
enables Singaporeans to live healthy lifestyles. Many of these efforts
will take time to show longer term health outcomes, and we will continue
to push on with our efforts, such as those under the War on Diabetes.
25.     To empower people to take charge of their health, we are also
leveraging technology, such as HealthHub which offers a wide range of
reliable and locally relevant content to improve their health literacy.
This allows individuals to take charge of the health of their families
and themselves, through using secure and personalised health information
and tools. More tips, resources and programmes are available for from
HealthHub at www.healthhub.sg.
26.     As health is ultimately a personal responsibility, everyone has
a role to play in achieving and sustaining better health of our nation.
Individuals can play a part by making conscious decisions towards a
healthier lifestyle.

consultation recommended an additional classification of BMI for public
health action among Asians where having a BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 was
considered as having high risk BMI.
[7] In NPHS 2017, 8.6% were obese and 18.7% had high risk BMI.
[8] Based on WHO's recommended level of physical activity, and indicated
as sufficient total physical activity in the NPHS report.
[9] In 2020, the largest contributor to total physical activity was
commuting (49.6%), followed by leisure-time physical activity (26.8%)
and work-related physical activity (23.6%).
[10] Leisure-time regular exercise refers to the participation in any
sports or exercise for ≥ 20 minutes per occasion for ≥ 3 days a week.
[11] Age-standardised prevalence for Singapore residents engaging in at
least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week has
decreased from 80.9% in 2017 to 76.8% during 2020, while the
age-standardised prevalence for leisure-time regular exercise has
increased from 29.8% in 2017 to 33.8% during 2020.

past 12 months. Annual influenza vaccination is part of the nationally
recommended vaccinations for individuals at risk of serious flu
complications including the elderly, young children and people with
certain chronic conditions.
[14] The National Adult Immunisation Schedule (2017) recommends all
persons aged 65 years or older to be vaccinated against pneumococcal
disease.
[15] A 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to measure
mental health. A respondent is identified to have poor mental health if
he or she have a score of 3 or more from the questionnaire.
[16] Age-standardised rate for poor mental health prevalence was 13.8%
in 2020 and 12.6% in 2017.
