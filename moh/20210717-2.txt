UPDATE ON CASES OF LOCALLY TRANSMITTED COVID-19 INFECTION AT JURONG FISHERY PORT


Published Date: 17 Jul 2021

       MOH is investigating seven cases of infection among individuals
at the Jurong Fishery Port as of 16 July 2021. The premises has been
closed for deep cleaning till 31 July.

2.    All who worked at the Jurong Fishery Port between 3 July to 16
July have already been placed on quarantine. Special Testing Ops are
ongoing for all visitors to the Port during that period.

3.     However, there has been spread from the Jurong Fishery Port to
Hong Lim Market, and there is a  risk of transmission of the virus to
other markets. As a precautionary measure, MOH has arranged with the
National Environment Agency to test fishmongers from all markets at our
test centres and distribute Antigen Rapid Test kits to them, so that
they can continue to monitor themselves. Details on this will be
released shortly.

4.     We understand that there is now a rush to buy fish. MOH advises
all visitors to the wet markets to avoid crowds and to do your marketing
during off-peak hours, or at supermarkets. Please be mindful of safe
management measures, by keeping a 1-metre distance from one another and
wearing your masks properly while marketing.
