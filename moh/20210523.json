They are largely Persons Under Quarantine who turned positive for COVID-19. This means that they have been isolated early and ring- fenced, and not likely to be moving around while being infectious. Nevertheless, MOH took all the necessary public health measures to prevent any further spread to the community.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have established that four of the units with confirmed cases are in the same stack, and our initial assessment is that airborne transmission along the stack is highly unlikely. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine linkages and the source of transmission.<br><br></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are therefore not taking any chances. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has worked with the town council (TC) to carry out stepped up cleaning measures to clean and disinfect the block. At the same time, we are casting our surveillance net as wide as possible, including administering PCR tests for the whole block.<br><br></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MOH has just concluded mandatory PCR tests for 407 residents and visitors of the block. This was done from 21 to 22 May 2021. Thus far, one individual was found to be positive for COVID-19 with 126 more test results pending. More details on the positive case will be reported in upcoming press releases by MOH.<br><br></span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;\">7. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those who are still awaiting their test results are advised to stay at home and seek immediate medical attention if they feel unwell.
