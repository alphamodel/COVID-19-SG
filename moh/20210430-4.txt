          The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has lifted the suspension of

of gastroenteritis involving 129 persons who consumed food prepared by
Chilli Api Catering Pte Ltd between 10 and 13 March 2021. 23 persons

cases either sought outpatient treatment, self-medicated, or recovered
without treatment. To protect consumers from further public health
risks, the food business operations of Chilli Api Catering Pte Ltd was
suspended by SFA from 14 March to 30 April 2021.
3              Investigation into the cause of the gastroenteritis
illness is ongoing.

has complied with measures stipulated by SFA. The licensee has disposed
all ready-to-eat food, thawed food and perishable food items, and also

PUBLIC ADVISORY
7              To prevent the spread of disease and protect oneself from
acquiring infections, individuals should practise good personal hygiene
at all times. These include:
•             Washing hands with soap and water before eating and after
going to the toilet;
•             Covering mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or
sneezing, and throwing the tissue away into a bin immediately; and
•             Not sharing food/drinks, eating utensils, toothbrushes or
towels with others.
8              In the interest of maintaining a high standard of food
hygiene at all eating establishments, we would also like to advise
members of the public who come across poor hygiene practices in food
establishments not to patronise such outlets but to report to SFA via
the online feedback form (www.sfa.gov.sg/feedback) with details for our
