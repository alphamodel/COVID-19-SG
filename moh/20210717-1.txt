UPDATE ON LOCAL COVID-19 SITUATION (17 JULY 2021)


Published Date: 17 Jul 2021

As of 17 July 2021, 12pm, Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and
verified that there are 60 cases of locally transmitted COVID-19
infection, of which 29 belong to the KTV cluster. Of the 60 cases today,
33 are linked to previous cases, and have already been placed on
quarantine. 25 are linked to previous cases and were detected through
surveillance. 2 are currently unlinked.1  There are 8 imported cases,
who have already been placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon
arrival in Singapore. 1 was detected upon arrival in Singapore, while 7
developed the illness during SHN or isolation. In total, there are 68
new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore today. There are currently
5 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 1 in
critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU).

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES
2. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased from
17 cases in the week before to 239 cases in the past week. We are likely
to see rising cases in the coming days as we step up efforts to detect
them to contain their spread in the community. The number of unlinked
cases in the community has also increased from 8 cases in the week
before to 22 cases in the past week. The 7-day moving average number of
all linked community cases and all unlinked community cases are 31.0 and
3.1 respectively.

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR IMPORTED CASES
3. There are a total of 8 imported cases today. 1 was detected upon
arrival in Singapore, while 7 developed the illness during SHN or
isolation.

ACTIVE CLUSTERS UNDER MONITORING
4. There are 3 new clusters today. In total, there are currently 29
active clusters, ranging between 3 and 148 infections. MOH has been
monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have
been no more cases linked to the Case 64263 cluster for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.

ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO RINGFENCE CLUSTERS
5. We have uncovered clusters involving markets and food centres. These
clusters are likely seeded by fishmongers who visited the Jurong Fishery
Port to collect their stock and sell at the markets. We announced the
cluster at Hong Lim Market & Food Centre yesterday, and MOH is now
investigating 2 cases who work in or visited Chong Boon Market & Food
Centre (453A Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10), with 3 more cases pending
confirmation. To break the chain of transmission and enable deep
cleaning of the premises, Chong Boon Market & Food Centre will be closed
to all members of the public from 18 July to 1 August 2021. All
individuals who work in the market and food centre will be placed on
quarantine, and tested during quarantine.
6. MOH has also detected cases amongst fishmongers working at Amoy
Street Food Centre, Chong Pang Market & Food Centre, Whampoa Wet Market,
Telok Blangah Crescent Block 11, Taman Jurong Market, Redhill Market,
Geylang Serai Malay Market, Geylang Bahru Market, 527 Ang Mo Kio Market,
726 West Coast Wet Market and Bukit Timah Wet Market.  Most are tested
positive via Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) and are being confirmed with
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Our epidemiological
investigations found that they are likely to have been infected through
contact with stallholders at Jurong Fishery Port.
7. Testing of fishmongers is still ongoing. As there is risk of
transmission to other markets and food centres, we are conducting
aggressive contact tracing, quarantine and testing to ringfence the
cases and prevent further spread. Fishmongers from all markets will
receive an SMS Health Risk Warning on 18 July, and will be required
under the law to get tested at  designated testing centres and
self-isolate until they receive a negative test from their first PCR
test. They will be issued with self-test ART kits and are required to
self-administer an ART test on the seventh day from the last exposure.
They will also be required to undergo another PCR test at designated
testing centres around the 14th day from their date of last known
exposure.
8. MOH therefore advises all visitors to the markets and food centres to
avoid crowds and to do your marketing during off-peak hours, or at
supermarkets, and to strictly observe the safe management measures.
Ongoing transmission at KTV clubs/lounges
9. MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst social
hostesses who had frequented KTV lounges or clubs currently operating as
F&B outlets, and their close social contacts. Our epidemiological
investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at
the following KTV lounges/clubs:
• Quinn KTV (207A Syed Alwi Road);
• Club AURA (442 Orchard Road);
• Club Ion (271 Bukit Timah Road);
• Icon II (35 Selegie Road);
• Club Lucky Thai (5001 Beach Road); and
• M. Sakhon (5001 Beach Road).
10. All visitors to the affected premises are advised to monitor their
health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for
14 days from their date of visit or interaction. They are encouraged to
see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.
CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
11. 196 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and under
observation. There are currently 5 cases of serious illness requiring
oxygen supplementation, and 1 in critical condition in the intensive
care unit (ICU). None amongst these 6 cases is fully vaccinated.

12. There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 14 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 10 are unvaccinated, 4 are partially vaccinated and none was fully
vaccinated.

PROGRESS OF NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAMME
13. As of 16 July 2021, we have administered a total of 6,650,677, doses
of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme. The total
number of doses administered was 6,650,677, covering 4,118,334
individuals. 2,609,367 individuals have completed the full vaccination
regimen, consisting of 77,024 recovered persons who received at least
one dose and 2,532,343 who received their second dose.
