decreased from 8 cases in the week before to 2 cases in the past week.
The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from 5

our surveillance programme.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
59321 is a 57 year-old female Singaporean who is a homemaker.
She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 13 January in preparation for a trip to Vietnam.
Her result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and
she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in an
ambulance.
Her polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test yielded a high Ct value, which
is indicative of a low viral load. Her serological test result has also
come back positive, which indicates a likely past infection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including her family members,
have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the
start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close
contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 29
Amongst the 29 imported cases,
• 1 (Case 59325) is a Singaporean and 5 (Cases 59304, 59305, 59306,
59320 and 59322) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from the
US, UK and India.
• 1 (Case 59297) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
India.
• 5 (Cases 59300, 59301, 59302, 59314 and 59319) are Work Pass holders
who arrived from India, Pakistan and the UAE.
• 13 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and
Myanmar, of whom 5 (Cases 59311, 59312, 59313, 59317 and 59318) are
foreign domestic workers.
• 1 (Case 59323) is a sea crew holding a Special Pass who arrived from
the UAE onboard a vessel on 11 January and had not disembarked. He was
tested for COVID-19, and conveyed to the hospital when his result came
back positive.
• 3 (Cases 59307, 59309 and 59326) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders.
Cases 59307 and 59309 arrived from India and Myanmar respectively to
study in Singapore. Case 59326 arrived India to visit her spouse who is
a Singapore Permanent Resident.
They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.
Cases 59315, 59316 and 59324 are Work Permit holders who arrived from
Bangladesh on 24 December 2020 and served SHN at dedicated facilities
until 7 January 2021. Their swabs done on 4 January during SHN were
negative for COVID-19, and subsequent tests on 8 January and 10 January
were also negative. Their tests on 13 January came back positive for
COVID-19 infection, although the Ct values were very high, which are
indicative of low viral loads. Their serological test results have also
come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we
have classified these cases as imported. They are likely to be shedding
minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and
infective to others.

(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

5.         There are currently 51 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 208 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from
