These claims were submitted by Dr Iqbal, who is also the clinic owner. As The Cliniq and Dr Iqbal are in breach of the terms and conditions of CHAS, MOH has revoked the MediSave accreditation of The Cliniq and Dr Iqbal. As Dr Iqbal is the clinic manager of MYCLNQ Medical, MOH has also revoked the MediSave accreditation of MYCLNQ Medical pursuant to the Terms and Conditions of Approval under the MediSave Scheme and MediShield Life Scheme. Given the severity of the alleged offences, MOH has also referred the case to the Police for further investigation.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the revocation, Dr Iqbal will not be able to make MediSave claims on behalf of his patients for treatments and surgical procedures. Once terminated from CHAS participation and revoked of MediSave accreditation, The Cliniq cannot make claims on behalf of patients for either scheme. MYCLNQ Medical cannot make claims on behalf of patients for MediSave claims. Affected patients may wish to visit other nearby CHAS-accredited or MediSave-accredited clinics instead.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MOH closely monitors clinics\u2019 CHAS and MediSave claims, and the majority of clinics and practitioners comply with our guidelines. MOH takes a serious view of fraudulent claims, and will not hesitate to take action where non-compliance is uncovered. We also remind healthcare professionals to uphold a high standard of professionalism, and adhere to their Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We encourage patients to actively engage their doctors and dentists if they have any queries on their treatment, or the charges imposed on their claims.
