His earlier tests from RRT \u2013 the last being on 17 December \u2013 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.<br><br>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family and household members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 19</strong><br><br>Amongst the 19 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>\u2022 1 (Case 59339) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from India.<br>\u2022 3 (Cases 59329, 59331 and 59332) are Dependant\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from the UAE and India.<br>\u2022 2 (Cases 59327 and 59330) are Student\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from India and France.&nbsp;<br>\u2022 5 (Cases 59328, 59337, 59341, 59342 and 59348) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India, Japan, Spain and the UAE.&nbsp;<br>\u2022 6 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India and Myanmar, of whom 3 (Cases 59333, 59335 and 59336) are foreign domestic workers.<br>\u2022 1 (Case 59346) is a sea crew holding a Special Pass who arrived from Brunei onboard a vessel on 5 January and had not disembarked.

Their swabs done on 5 January during SHN were negative for COVID-19, and subsequent tests on 9 January and 11 January were also negative. Their tests on 14 January came back positive for COVID-19 infection, although the Ct values were very high, which are indicative of low viral loads. Their serological test results have also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified these cases as imported. They are likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annexesc1d1cad3fc8c4266b28168000969b17f.pdf?sfvrsn=910a9d7e_0\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;13 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,784 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are currently 54 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 216 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The recent locally transmitted cases are a stark reminder that we cannot afford to let our guard down. We must continue to keep up our discipline in adhering to the safe management and safe distancing measures, so as to avoid an uncontrolled resurgence of cases that may necessitate a tightening of measures.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>16 JANUARY 2021</strong><br></span></p><div><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><br></span></div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "5-new-cases-of-locally-transmitted-covid-19-infection-16-Jan-2021", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "Updates On Border Measures and Travel Insurance ", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1610805600000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "16 Jan 2021", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Multi-Ministry Taskforce regularly reviews Singapore\u2019s border measures to manage the risk of importation and onward local transmission from travellers. Given the resurgence of COVID-19 cases around the world, we will be putting in place more stringent measures for travellers to manage the risk of importation.&nbsp;<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">On-arrival Testing for Travellers<br></span><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We currently require travellers who are not Singapore Citizens (SCs) or Permanent Residents (PRs), and who have recent travel history to high-risk countries/ regions, to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure. These travellers are then required to serve their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and they are tested at the end of their SHN.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given the emergence of new virus variants and the worsening COVID-19 situation around the world, we will put in place additional border control measures for all travellers. In particular, <strong>from 24 January 2021, 2359 hours, all travellers (including SCs and PRs) will need to take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore</strong><sup>1</sup>. The prevailing SHN requirements, including the PCR test at the end of the SHN, will continue.&nbsp;<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Further Precautions for Travellers from the United Kingdom and South Africa<br><br></span>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We had earlier restricted entry and transit for all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to the UK and South Africa. This arose from concerns of a more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus circulating in these countries.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a further precaution, from 18 January 2021, 2359 hours, until further notice, all returning SCs and PRs from the UK and South Africa will be subject to an additional 7-day self-isolation at their place of residence, following their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. The returnees from the UK and South Africa will be tested at the end of their SHN (as per the current requirement), and again after they have completed their 7-day self-isolation period. These further precautions will apply to travellers who are currently serving their SHN.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>Insurance Coverage<br></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, short-term visitors entering Singapore under the Air Travel Pass (ATP) and Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs) are required to bear the full costs of medical treatment, should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19 or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With effect from <strong>31 January 2021, 2359 hours, visitors applying to enter Singapore under the ATP and RGLs will need to have travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000.</strong> The travel insurance will help them pay for the costs of their medical treatment in Singapore. The visitors can purchase the travel insurance from Singapore-based or overseas insurers.
