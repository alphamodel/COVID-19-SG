Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Closure of ION Orchard from 12 June</span><br><br>6. MOH is investigating 3 cases (Cases 64112, 64114 and 64135) of COVID-19 infection amongst individuals who work in ION Orchard. To break any potential chain of transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, ION Orchard will be closed to all members of the public starting from 12 June 2021 and re-open 4 days later, on 16 June 2021.<br><br>7. In order to disrupt any wider, undetected community transmission, we will conduct special testing operations for staff who have been working in ION Orchard shopping mall from 28 May. We will also extend free COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited the retail shops or used the services/ facilities at ION Orchard between 3 June to 11 June. Individuals who had only walked through the mall to connect to neighbouring buildings or Orchard MRT station need not be tested. Please refer to <a href="http://go.gov.sg/ion-testing" title="" class="" target="">http://go.gov.sg/ion-testing</a>&nbsp;for details on the testing operations.<br><br>8. All visitors to ION Orchard between 3 June and 11 June are advised to monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for 14 days from their date of visit.
