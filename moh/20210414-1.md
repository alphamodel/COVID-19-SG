The number of unlinked cases in the community has decreased from 2 cases in the week before to 1 case in the past week. . We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst the 165 confirmed cases reported from 8 April to 14 April, 63 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 72 have tested negative, and 30 serology test results are pending.<br><br><strong>Case Details</strong><br><br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 1</strong><br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to previous cases.&nbsp;<br><br>Case 61917, a 44 year-old male Papua New Guinea national, is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Australia on 25 March for a work project here. His pre-departure test done in Australia on 23 March was negative for COVID-19, as was his on-arrival test in Singapore on 25 March. Thereafter he had remained isolated until another COVID-19 test taken on 27 March came back negative. Subsequently he was on a controlled itinerary, which was largely limited to his place of work and accommodation. Another test done on 31 March also came back negative for COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>As he had been identified as a close contact of Cases 61461 and 61470, he was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 1 April. His swab done on 2 April during quarantine was negative for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, but another test taken on 12 April during quarantine came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed to a hospital via an ambulance. His serology test result is pending.&nbsp;<br><br>We have classified this case as locally transmitted as he had repeatedly tested negative for COVID-19 before 12 April. He was likely to have been infected through his exposure to Cases 61461 and 61470 during the course of their work.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 26</strong><br><br>Amongst the 26 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>-&nbsp; 1 (Case 61924) is a Singaporean and 4 (Cases 61902, 61907, 61918 and 61925) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India and the Philippines.<br>-&nbsp; 1 (Case 61911) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from Sri Lanka.<br>-&nbsp; 2 (Cases 61914 and 61932) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India and Nepal.<br>-&nbsp; 17 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and Indonesia, of whom 4 (Cases 61927, 61931, 61934 and 61936) are foreign domestic workers.<br>-&nbsp; 1 (Case 61915) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who is a sea crew.

In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; 18 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,392 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are currently 61 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 2 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 236 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
