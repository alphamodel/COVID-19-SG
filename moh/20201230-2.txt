Minimum Legal Age for Tobacco Raised to 21 Years Old From 1 January 2021



MINIMUM LEGAL AGE FOR TOBACCO RAISED TO 21 YEARS OLD FROM 1 JANUARY 2021


Published Date: 30 Dec 2020

1.      From 1 January 2021, the Minimum Legal Age for the purchase,
use, possession, sale and supply of tobacco products (MLA) will be
raised from 20 to 21 years old.
2.  Raising the MLA is part of Singapore's ongoing efforts to reduce
smoking prevalence. It aims to prevent youth from picking up smoking by
limiting access to tobacco products, and to further de-normalise smoking
particularly for those below 21 of age.
3.  The change in the MLA from 18 to 21 years old was debated and
passed in Parliament on 7 November 2017, as part of the Tobacco (Control
of Advertisements and Sale) (Amendment) Bill 2017. The MLA was
subsequently raised from 18 to 19 years old on 1 January 2019, and from
19 years old to 20 years old on 1 January 2020.
4.  The tobacco industry, including retailers, importers and
wholesalers, have been reminded of the changes. Warning notices, stating
that sale of tobacco to persons below the age of 21 is not permitted,
have been distributed to retailers for display at their outlets.
5.  Retailers who contravene the law and sell any tobacco products
to a person below the MLA shall be liable on conviction to a maximum
fine of $5,000 for the first offence and $10,000 for subsequent
offences. In addition, their tobacco retail licences will be suspended
for the first offence and revoked for subsequent offences. If any outlet
is found selling tobacco products to underage persons in school uniform
or those below 12 years of age, its tobacco retail licence will be
revoked, even at the first offence.
6.  Persons caught giving or furnishing tobacco to a person below
the MLA shall be liable on conviction to a maximum fine of $500 for the
first offence and $1,000 for subsequent offences. Persons caught buying
or acquiring tobacco for a person below the MLA shall be liable on
conviction to a maximum fine of $2,500 for the first offence and $5,000
for subsequent offences. Underage smokers who are caught using, buying
or having in their possession tobacco products are liable on conviction
to a fine of up to $300.
7.  Members of the public can report errant retailers to the Health
Sciences Authority's (HSA) Tobacco Regulation Branch using the online
form at go.gov.sg/reporttobaccooffences. Alternatively, they can call
6684 2036 or 6684 2037 during office hours (9:00am to 5:30pm, Monday to
Friday).
8.  Tobacco use is one of the highest contributors to ill health and
premature death in Singapore. It is associated with cancers (e.g. mouth,
lung), ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lung disease and many other
diseases.
9.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) is committed to lowering smoking
prevalence in Singapore through a comprehensive, multipronged approach
to discourage and reduce the use of tobacco products. Together with the
Health Promotion Board, HSA, our partners and the wider community, we
have adopted a range of tobacco control measures to reduce smoking
prevalence. In addition to MLA, the range of tobacco control measures
include public education, taxation, smoking cessation programmes, bans
on tobacco advertising, point-of-sale display ban, and standardised
packaging of tobacco products.
