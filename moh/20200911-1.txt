A)  Imported cases: 13¹ (3 Singaporeans, 7 Permanent Residents, 2
Dependant’s Pass holders, 1 Student’s Pass holder)

Amongst the 13 imported cases, 3 (Cases 57378, 57422 and 57452) are
Singaporeans and 7 (Cases 57377, 57423, 57424, 57425, 57426, 57427 and
57428) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from
Egypt on 27 August, India on 28 August and 30 August and the Philippines
on 30 August. Another 2 (Cases 57429 and 57453) are Dependant’s Pass
holders who arrived from India on 30 August and the USA on 30 August.
The remaining case (Case 57454) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived
from India on 30 August.

All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.

B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0

There are no cases in the community today.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 73

Amongst the 73 cases residing in dormitories, 34 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.

The remaining 39 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.

Of the cases residing in dormitories today, 33 are from Avery Lodge
Dormitory, the majority of whom had been placed on quarantine earlier
and were tested during quarantine to determine their status. The
remaining cases were detected through surveillance testing.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past
infections [2].The serological test results for 38 cases have come back
positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.  Of the new cases, 86% are imported or linked to known
cases/ clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

4.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact
tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
Please refer to Annex B and Annex Cfor details.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

5.  49 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 56,607 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

6.  There are currently 49 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 632 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.

[2] Updated from the afternoon press release as an imported case has
been removed following investigation. Case 57451 has presented medical
records documenting that she had earlier recovered from COVID-19
infection and is no longer infectious.
