    <body><h1>Extension of the Suspension of In-person Visits At Residential Care Homes </h1>
    <p>Published Date: 05 Oct 2021</p> <p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The Ministry of Health (MOH) had earlier announced on 12 September 2021 that in-person visits at all residential care homes (“Homes”) will be suspended from 13 September to 11 October 2021 (both dates inclusive), given the increasing number of COVID-19 cases amongst staff and residents of Homes. In light of the emergence of several new clusters at Homes in the past two weeks and the continued rise of COVID-19 cases within the community, we will be extending the suspension of in-person visits to all Homes to 24 October 2021 (inclusive). This is in line with the Stabilisation Phase and will reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 from the community to the Homes. The extension will also provide more time for our seniors in the Homes to get vaccinated or receive their booster shots.</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We urge the next-of-kin of unvaccinated seniors in the Homes to support and encourage their loved ones to get vaccinated. Unvaccinated seniors are more likely to suffer severe illness if infected. It is also important for vaccinated seniors to receive their booster dose immediately when they become eligible, to ensure a continued high level of immunity and protection from severe disease.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that seniors remain connected with their loved ones, the Homes will continue to offer caregivers/next-of-kin the option of telephone or video calls as an alternative to physical visits.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will observe the situation in the coming weeks and will review the suspension of visitation accordingly. We seek the understanding and cooperation of all Singaporeans as we continue to implement measures to protect our seniors.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br></span></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>5 OCTOBER 2021</strong></span></span></p></body>
