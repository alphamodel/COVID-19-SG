A) IMPORTED CASES: 2 (1 Work Pass holder, 1 Work Permit holder)
Both imported cases (Cases 57803 and 57804) are Work Pass/ Permit
holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India and the
Philippines on 13 September. They had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home
Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving
their SHN at dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an
average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 9
Amongst the 9 cases residing in dormitories, 7 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 2 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.       Of the new cases, 91% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.       Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.       8 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,341 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.       There are currently 29 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 268 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
