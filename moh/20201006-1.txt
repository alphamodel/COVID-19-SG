2.     Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased
from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 2
cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community
has remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the
past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well
as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.
3.     Of the new cases, 64% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2
Both cases in the community had been identified as household contacts of
previously confirmed cases, and were placed on quarantine earlier. Cases
57970 and 57971 were placed on quarantine on 3 October, but had not left
their home since 28 September. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status, even though they are both asymptomatic. Case
57970 is a student at a private school, and was last in school on 18
September. Case 57971 is a homemaker.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 5
Amongst the 5 cases residing in dormitories, 1 had been identified
earlier as a contact of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. He was tested during quarantine to
determine his status.
The remaining 4 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 4
There are 4 imported cases today who are asymptomatic. They had all been
placed on 14-day SHN upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while
serving SHN at dedicated facilities.
4.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
5.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
6.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.     15 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,612 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.     There are currently 43 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 148 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
