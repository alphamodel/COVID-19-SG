history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.
64. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following
precautions at all times:
•   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
of illness;
•   Observe good personal hygiene;
•   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
•   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
shortness of breath;
•   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
•   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.
