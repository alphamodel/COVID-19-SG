75 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 09 Sep 2020

          As of 9 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 75 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. Based on our investigations so far, there is 1 case in the
community, who is a Work Pass holder.

2.  There are 14 imported cases, who had all been placed on
Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.

3.  Amongst the 60 cases residing in dormitories today, 31 are
from Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, the vast majority of whom had been
placed on quarantine earlier and were tested during quarantine to
determine their status. The remaining cases were detected through
surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing.
This allows us to pick up cases in the dormitory early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission.

4.  We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
