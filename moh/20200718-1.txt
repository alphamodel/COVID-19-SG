Published Date: 18 Jul 2020

       As of 18 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 202 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 8 (2 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 4 Work Pass
holders, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder, 1 Special Pass holder)
Amongst the 8 imported cases, 2 (Cases 47649 and 47721) are
Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India
on 6 July and from Pakistan on 4 July. 4 cases (Cases 47697, 47698,
47699 and 47715) are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in
Singapore. Another case (Case 47685) is a Dependant’s Pass holder. They
arrived in Singapore from India between 6 July and 15 July. All 7 of
them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in
Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN.
The remaining case (Case 47613) had arrived in Singapore from the
Philippines on 16 July, and was conveyed directly to the National Centre
for Infectious Diseases as he was symptomatic. He is a sailor currently
holding a Special Pass who will join a vessel that called in our Port.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 7 (5 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Work
Permit holder, 1 Student’s Pass holder)
Of the 7 cases in the community, 3 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. 4 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected
through our proactive testing.
3 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters.
Of these, 1 (Case 47686) had been identified as a contact of previously
confirmed cases, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. He was
tested during quarantine to determine his status, even though he is
asymptomatic. Another case (Case 47655) is also asymptomatic, and was
identified from our periodic testing of individuals working in essential
services. The remaining case (Case 47632) was tested for COVID-19 under
our enhanced community testing. He is a family contact of 2 other cases
announced yesterday, and all 3 were confirmed to have COVID-19 on the
same day.
4 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 2 cases
(Cases 47541 and 47723) had been detected as a result of our screening
of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories.
The remaining 2 cases (Cases 47544 and 47654) were swabbed under our
enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who
are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at first presentation to
a doctor. This allows us to detect infected individuals early and to
quickly contain further spread.
Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to
determine if these cases could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 18 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 9 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 9 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 5 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 187
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     Of the new cases, 97% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.     The Inter-Agency Task Force has been systematically and
progressively clearing dormitories through aggressive testing of migrant
workers residing in dormitories. Changi Lodge II (80 Tanah Merah Coast
Road) and Sungei Tengah Lodge (500 Old Choa Chu Kang Road) have been
cleared, and now house only recovered individuals and those who have
recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As such, the clusters
have now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.     In the past week (11 July to 17 July), MOH has uncovered links
for 1 previously unlinked case in the community.
6.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.     256 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 43,833 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.     There are currently 169 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 3,626 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
