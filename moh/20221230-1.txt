MOH Closely Monitoring Global Covid-19 Situation; Ready to Step Up
Border Health Measures If Needed



MOH CLOSELY MONITORING GLOBAL COVID-19 SITUATION; READY TO STEP UP BORDER HEALTH MEASURES IF NEEDED


Published Date: 30 Dec 2022

     There has been some public concern about the high level of
infections in China and the latest announcements to relax their border
measures on 8 January 2023. Certain countries, namely India, Italy,
Japan, and the US, have announced new testing requirements for all
travellers from China. Others, including most EU countries, Australia,
New Zealand, the UK, and other Southeast Asian counties are monitoring
the situation and have not announced any tightening of border measures
on Chinese travellers.



2.     At this stage of the pandemic, the most important factor is our
population immunity. We cannot completely stop infections, and indeed
the virus has continued to circulate in our communities, but we can
ensure that infections result in few cases of hospitalisations and
severe illnesses.



3.     In this regard, our local epidemiological situation has remained
stable after the XBB wave, with a seven-day moving average of local
COVID-19 cases at 729, the number of COVID-19 related
hospitalisations staying below 100, and COVID-19 related patients in the
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) remaining in the single digits.



4.     We have introduced paediatric and bivalent COVID-19 vaccines, to
strengthen our already high community hybrid immunity. We have
also bolstered our healthcare capacity with new COVID-19 Treatment
Facilities and expanded Transitional Care Facilities. As 2022 comes to
an end, we are in a stronger position to live with COVID-19, becoming
more resilient with each COVID-19 wave.



KEEPING A CLOSE WATCH ON THE EMERGENCE OF NEW VARIANTS



5.     Nevertheless, we are closely watching the global COVID-19
situation worldwide. Caseloads have gone up in many countries, due to
the uptick in international travel and onset of winter in the Northern
Hemisphere. As the Ministry of Health (MOH) has highlighted previously,
China, which is facing a large infection wave, is currently of
particular concern.



6.     There are two specific concerns. First, the possible emergence of
new and more dangerous variants. Singapore has been working with our
international partners, including GISAID, which maintains a pathogen
genomics database, to monitor the variants circulating globally. We
also conduct our own genomic surveillance on local and imported cases.
So far, based on the sequencing results submitted by the Centres for
Disease Control of various Chinese cities, the strains circulating in
China are known ones, and no new variants with greater transmissibility
or severity than previously identified subvariants have been detected.

WATCHING HOSPITAL WORKLOAD CLOSELY



7.     The second concern is that travellers should not add significant
burden to our hospitals.



8.     At present, our airport sees between 700 and 1,000 arrivals from
China daily, or about 1% to 1.5% of total daily arrivals by
air. The majority comprise residents and long-term pass
holders returning to Singapore. On a weekly basis, we have detected
between 40 and 80 COVID-19 cases from among these travellers. All of
them exhibited mild symptoms, except one returning Singaporean who had
become severely ill after recent travel to China.



9.     As air travel with China is progressively restored, we will take
a cautious approach towards increasing seat capacity, taking into
account the overall public health assessment.



REVIEWING BORDER MEASURES



10.     While many countries had previously fully lifted public
health-related border measures, Singapore did not do so and has
maintained some measures. Non-fully vaccinated travellers entering
Singapore continue to require a pre-departure test (PDT) within two days
before departure. Non-fully vaccinated Short-Term Visitors (STVs) are
also required to obtain travel insurance with a minimum coverage of
S$30,000 for COVID-related medical expenses. All air and sea travellers
are required to submit a health declaration upon arrival. These measures
reduce the risk of having severely ill imported cases, which can take
up our healthcare capacity. At this juncture, we will continue to
maintain these prevailing vaccination requirements and border measures
for non-fully vaccinated travellers.



11.     However, we are watching the situation closely, including both
upstream developments and the loading on our own healthcare system. We
stand ready to reinstate border health measures for selected countries
if warranted by the public health situation.
