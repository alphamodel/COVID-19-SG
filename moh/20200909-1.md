    <body><h1>75 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 09 Sep 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 9 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 75 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. Based on our investigations so far, there is 1 case in the community, who is a Work Pass holder.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 14 imported cases, who had all been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.&nbsp;<br></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst the 60 cases residing in dormitories today, 31 are from Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, the vast majority of whom had been placed on quarantine earlier and were tested during quarantine to determine their status. The remaining cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing. This allows us to pick up cases in the dormitory early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission.<br></p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.<br></p><p><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>9 SEPTEMBER 2020</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p><div><br></div></body>
