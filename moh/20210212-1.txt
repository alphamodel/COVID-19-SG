from 4 cases in the week before to 8 cases in the past week. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from 3 cases in
the week before to 5 cases in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

3.  Amongst the 128 confirmed cases reported from 6 February
to 12 February, 66 cases have tested positive for their serology tests,
32 have tested negative, and 30 serology test results are pending.



CASE DETAILS

A)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2

There are 2 cases in the community today, who are linked to previous
cases.



Case 60191

Case 60191 is a 33 year-old male Singaporean who is the son of Cases
60138[1] and 60192, and is currently unemployed.

As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 60138, he was
placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February. On 11
February, he was tested for COVID-19 even though he is asymptomatic. His
test result came back positive on the same day, and he was conveyed in
an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His
serology test result has come back positive.



Case 60192

Case 60192 is a 62 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case
60138[1], and is a homemaker.

She was placed on quarantine at a dedicated facility on 10 February when
Case 60138 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. She was tested for
COVID-19 on the same day even though she is asymptomatic. Her test came
back positive on 11 February, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to
NCID. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that
this is likely a current infection.

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them.

Effective contact tracing is an important enabler to ringfence community
transmission. Both Cases 60191 and 60192 do not use the TraceTogether
App, and while they both have TraceTogether tokens, they did not carry
their tokens with them. Individuals are reminded to turn on their
TraceTogether App or carry their TraceTogether token at all times so
that we can quickly identify and isolate the close contacts of COVID-19
cases, and limit further infections.

B)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.

C)  IMPORTED CASES: 16

Amongst the 16 imported cases,

•  3 (Cases 60163, 60172 and 60179) are Singapore Permanent
Residents who returned from India and Indonesia.
•  1 (Case 60178) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived
from the UAE.
•  1 (Case 60162) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who
arrived from Indonesia.
•  4 (Cases 60171, 60182, 60183, and 60184) are Work Pass
holders who arrived from Myanmar, the Philippines and UAE.
•  7 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India,
Indonesia and Myanmar, of whom 6 (Cases 60173, 60174, 60175, 60176,
60177 and 60180) are foreign domestic workers.

They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.

Case 60162 is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Indonesia
on 26 November 2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 10
December. His swab done on 6 December during SHN was negative for
COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 10 February 2021 in preparation for his return to
Indonesia. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the
next day, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a
low viral load. His serological test result has also come back positive.
He reported that before his trip to Singapore, he had interacted with
his sibling in Indonesia who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection in
October 2020. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have
classified the case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute
fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and
infective to others.
