Published Date: 11 Aug 2020

      As of 11 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 61 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 3 (2 Long-Term Visit Pass holders, 1 Dependant’s Pass
holder)
Amongst the 3 imported cases, 2 (Cases 55403 and 55408) are Long-Term
Visit Pass holders who arrived from India on 28 July and 29 July.  The
remaining case (Case 55415) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived
from India on 30 July. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home
Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (2 Singaporeans)
Both of the community cases today are linked to previous cases. Cases
55381 and 55382 are family members who had been identified as contacts
of previously confirmed cases. They had been placed on quarantine, and
were tested when they reported having symptoms.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 56
The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in
the dormitories. There are currently about 22,500 workers who are still
serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when
their isolation ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in
the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.

rest are pending contact tracing.
