2.  Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased
from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of
fewer than 1 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in
the community has also decreased from an average of fewer than 1 case
per day in the week before, to none in the past week. We will continue
to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through
our surveillance programme.
3.  All the new cases today are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters.
CASE DETAILS
A)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is a family member of
previously confirmed cases. Case 58037 had been identified as a contact
of Cases 57860 and 57933, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. All
3 cases had arrived from India on 16 September, and were placed on SHN
at a dedicated facility. Cases 57860 and 57933 subsequently tested
positive for COVID-19 infection on 27 September and 1 October
respectively. Case 58037 was tested during quarantine to determine her
status, even though she is asymptomatic.
B)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today who had been identified
earlier as a contact of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. He was tested during quarantine to
determine his status, even though he is asymptomatic.
C)  IMPORTED CASES: 2
There are 2 imported cases today. Case 58032 is a Singapore Permanent
Resident who returned to Singapore from the Philippines, and Case 58036
is a Work Pass holder currently employed in Singapore who arrived from
India and the UAE. They had both been placed on 14-day SHN upon arrival
in Singapore, and were tested while serving SHN even though they are
asymptomatic.
4.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH's daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
5.  Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
6.  MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the dormitory
at 9 Sungei Kadut Avenue for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28
days), the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
7.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
8.  23 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,728 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
9.  There are currently 48 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 76 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
10.  Case 57960, a 64 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident, has
passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 12 October
2020. He had been working in India since December 2019, and was placed
on SHN when he returned to Singapore on 23 September 2020. He was
confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 4 October, and had a history of
hypertension. Singapore General Hospital has reached out to his family
and is extending assistance to them.
