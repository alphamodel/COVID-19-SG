    <body><h1>210 More Cases Discharged, 278 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 30 Jul 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 30 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 278 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 4 </strong>(3 Work Pass holders, 1 Work Permit holder)<br><br>Amongst the 4 imported cases, 3 (Cases 51725, 51829 and 51830) are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in Singapore, and had arrived from India between 15 July and 18 July. The remaining case (Case 51889) is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Indonesia on 18 July. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 4 </strong>(1 Singaporean, 3 Work Permit holders)<br><br>All 4 cases in the community today are linked to the cluster at Bukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub. They are asymptomatic, and were detected as part of our proactive case finding of individuals working at a newly emergent workplace cluster. To determine if these cases are current or past infections, we also conducted serological tests for them, and the results for all 4 cases have come back positive, which indicate likely past infections . As a precautionary measure, MOH is working with the Land Transport Authority to arrange for close contacts of these cases to be tested. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 270</strong><br><br>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
