Published Date: 21 Jul 2020

           As of 21 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 399 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in
foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there
are 9 cases in the community, of whom 1 is a Singaporean and 8 are Work
Pass holders. In addition, there are 3 imported cases who had been
isolated or placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.
2.       The higher number of cases today is mainly due to a batch of
test results from the previous day reported to MOH after the 12pm
cut-off for yesterdayâ€™s reporting.
3.     We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
