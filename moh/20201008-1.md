    <p>Published Date: 08 Oct 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 8 October 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified 4 new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. All 4 reside in dormitories and there is none in the community. In addition, there are 5 imported cases, who had all been placed on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival. All cases today are asymptomatic and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Summary of new cases</strong><br></span></span></p><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;

The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the new cases, 78% are imported or linked to known cases/ clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Case Details</strong><br><br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 0&nbsp;</strong><br><br>There are no new cases in the community today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 4</strong><br><br>Amongst the 4 cases residing in dormitories, 1 had been identified earlier as a contact of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. He was tested during quarantine to determine his status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 3 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 5&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 57993) is a Singaporean who returned from Nepal on 25 September. Another 2 cases are currently employed in Singapore. Case 57994 is an engineer who is on a short-term work project in Singapore, and arrived from France on 5 October, while Case 57998 arrived from Japan on 6 October. The remaining 2 (Cases 57995 and 57996) are crew members of a ship which arrived in Singapore from Malaysia on 23 September. They did not disembark from the ship and were isolated after Case 57922 had been confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. They were swabbed while quarantined on the ship, where they had remained until their test results came back positive for COVID-19 and were then conveyed by ambulance to a hospital.<br><br>They had all been placed on 14-day SHN or isolated upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested even though all of them are asymptomatic.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong><br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

In all, 57,668 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are currently 35 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 119 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>8 OCTOBER 2020<br></strong></span><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><br></span></div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><br></span></div></body>
