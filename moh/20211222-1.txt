Remaining Vigilant Against the Omicron Variant



REMAINING VIGILANT AGAINST THE OMICRON VARIANT


Published Date: 22 Dec 2021

        In response to the emergence of the Omicron variant globally,
the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) had introduced travel restrictions
for affected countries/regions and enhanced our testing regime for
travellers, including those arriving via the Vaccinated Travel Lanes
(VTLs).
2.     We are picking up more Omicron cases because of the rapid spread
of the variant across many countries/regions. Thus far, our enhanced
testing regime for travellers has helped us to detect 65 confirmed
Omicron cases. With aggressive contact tracing and ringfencing measures,
we have, for now, been able to limit onward community transmission. But
it is a matter of time before the Omicron variant spreads in our
community.
3.     Our border measures will help to buy us time to study and
understand the Omicron variant, and to strengthen our defences,
including enhancing our healthcare capacity, and getting more people
vaccinated and boosted.
4.     Meanwhile, we need everyone to remain vigilant to reduce the
risks of widespread community transmission, and to keep yourself, your
loved ones and the community safe.  In particular, travellers must
adhere closely to the travel health control measures.
STRICTER ENFORCEMENT FOR TRAVELLERS ON VACCINATED TRAVEL LANE\S
5.     We remind all VTL travellers¹ that they must strictly adhere to
the enhanced testing regime upon arrival in Singapore. VTL travellers
are required to undergo an on-arrival test²  and test themselves daily
using self-administered antigen rapid tests (ARTs). On Days 2, 4, 5 and
6, travellers are required to submit the results of their
self-administered ART online using a link which will be sent to them via
their declared contact details after arrival in Singapore. On Days 3 and
7, the tests must be done under supervision at a Combined Test Centre
(CTC) or Quick Test Centre (QTC).³ Please refer to the Annex for an
illustration of the testing regime.
6.     TRAVELLERS MUST TEST NEGATIVE ON THEIR SELF-ADMINISTERED ART
BEFORE GOING OUT FOR ACTIVITIES ON THAT DAY, except on Days 3 and 7
whereby travellers are to undergo their supervised test at a CTC or QTC
before going about any other activities on that day. Travellers must
take their ARTs and submit their self-administered ART results as
necessary in a timely manner. Travellers who do not undergo the required
tests and/or submit their results will be issued a Stay-Order/Stay-Home
Notice (SHN), and will also face enforcement actions under the
Infectious Diseases Act.
7.     In view of the rise in Omicron cases globally, travellers should
exercise personal responsibility, minimise their social interactions,
and refrain from high-risk mask off activities (such as dining at F&B
establishments, exercising in gyms or attending fitness classes), as
well as avoid large gatherings and crowded places for 7 days from
arrival, even if they have a negative daily ART result. Travellers who
are unwell, including those showing early/mild symptoms should be
socially responsible and seek medical attention immediately.
FREEZING OF NEW VTL BOOKINGS
8.     To limit our exposure to imported Omicron cases, we will impose
limits on the number of VTL arrivals for the time being. We will fREEZE
ALL NEW TICKET SALES FOR VTL FLIGHTS AND BUSES FOR TRAVEL INTO SINGAPORE
FROM 23 DECEMBER 2021 TO 20 JANUARY 2022, BOTH DATES INCLUSIVE. All
travellers who already hold a ticket on a VTL flight or bus and meet all
the other VTL requirements can continue to travel under the VTL. We will
also temporarily reduce the VTL quotas and ticket sales for travel after
20 January 2022.  We will continue to monitor developments closely and
update this policy as the situation changes.
9.     The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will provide
further details for the VTL-Air, and the Ministry of Trade & Industry
(MTI) for the VTL-Land.
REMAINING VIGILANT AGAINST THE OMICRON VARIANT
10.     We seek everyone’s continued effort and cooperation to exercise
social responsibility and comply with all the measures that have been
put in place. Test yourself regularly and follow the health protocols.
Only by doing so can we strengthen our collective resilience against the
evolving COVID-19 situation.
