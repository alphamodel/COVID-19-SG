{"pressItemDictionary": {"Press Releases": [{"Title": "Updated Measures for Monkeypox ", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1659362400000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "01 Aug 2022", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp;With effect from 1 August 2022, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will transfer monkeypox cases assessed by the public hospitals to be clinically stable to a dedicated Monkeypox Isolation Facility (MIF), and adjust the quarantine period for close contacts to 14 days, followed by seven days of monitoring for symptoms. These updated public health measures are in line with the latest local and international data, including that from the World Health Organization (WHO).<br><br><strong>Transfer of confirmed cases to a Monkeypox Isolation Facility</strong><br><br>2. Monkeypox is typically a mild and self-limiting illness where the majority of patients recover within two to four weeks without requiring hospitalisation. Those particularly vulnerable to complications are young children, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>3. Previously, all confirmed cases of monkeypox were isolated in hospitals until they are non-infectious. On 29 July 2022, as part of a pilot to transit monkeypox cases to recover in the community, eight cases were conveyed from our public hospitals to the MIF. These cases are all currently in stable condition with mild symptoms.&nbsp;<br><br>4. From 1 August 2022, all confirmed cases assessed by the public hospitals to be clinically stable will be conveyed to the MIF with 24/7 telemedicine support. These cases will recover in the MIF until they are deemed to be non-infectious and fit for discharge. Cases assessed by the public hospitals to be at higher risk of complications will continue to be managed in hospitals. This allows hospitals to preserve their capacity for cases with more severe symptoms or complications.<br><br><strong>Adjustment of quarantine regime for close contacts</strong><br><br>5. Given that transmission requires close physical or prolonged contact, including face to face and skin to skin contact such as sexual contact, the risk to the general public remains low. Evidence also points to a mean incubation period of approximately eight to nine days with most close contacts developing symptoms by Day 14 from their last exposure to a confirmed case.<br><br>6. Previously, close contacts were quarantined for up to 21 days from their last date of exposure to a confirmed case date. From 1 August 2022, persons under quarantine will be quarantined for 14 days followed by seven days of monitoring for symptoms via regular phone calls. These individuals will be able to complete their quarantine from home. Those who are unable to complete their quarantine from home will be transferred to a Government Quarantine Facility.<br><br>7. MOH will continue to monitor the monkeypox situation closely and calibrate our preparedness and response measures as needed. Members of the public are encouraged to exercise personal responsibility by monitoring their personal health, maintaining good hygiene, and avoiding high-risk sexual activity, such as having multiple sex partners or casual sex, especially during travel. They should also avoid close contact with individuals known or suspected to be ill with monkeypox infection.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>1 AUGUST 2022</strong><br></span></span><div><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><br></span></div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "updated-measures-for-monkeypox", "CurrentPageUrl": null, "CustomPressWidgetLocationUrl": null}, {"Title": "Update to the Number of Local Covid-19 Deaths In 2021", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1659355200000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "01 Aug 2022", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ministry of Health (MOH) has revised the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 from 803 to 821. The adjustment follows an annual reconciliation exercise after the Registry of Births and Deaths finalised its report for 2021.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Doctors are required to notify MOH of COVID-19 deaths as soon as possible. Based on the doctors\u2019 submissions, MOH publishes the number of COVID-19 deaths on our website every day. Under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act 2021, doctors are also required to report information on the cause of death to the Registry of Births and Deaths. The Report on Registration of Births and Deaths for the preceding year is finalised and publicised every June.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, a total of 18 deaths will be added to MOH\u2019s official COVID-19 death count for 2021 following the reconciliation exercise, representing a 2.2% increase from the previous count. There is no difference in the number of COVID-19 deaths for 2020.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The following are the adjustments to the recorded number of deaths following the reconciliation exercise between MOH records and the Registry\u2019s Report:<br><br>a) Eight deaths had not been reported to MOH but were reported to the Registry. MOH will remind doctors to report all COVID-19 deaths to the Ministry.<br><br>b) 11 deaths had been reported to MOH, but COVID-19 infection was not indicated as the underlying cause of death in the notifications to MOH, as doctors report the cause of death based on available medical information at the point of reporting. These deaths were subsequently reported to the Registry with COVID-19 infection as the cause of death after further review by the doctors.<br><br>c) One death was in the MOH COVID-19 count for 2021, and in the Registry\u2019s count for 2022. This was due to differences in the date of reporting to MOH and the Registry because the death occurred on 31 December 2021. MOH will include the case in the 2022 count instead of the 2021 count&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Five deaths from the Report on Registration of Births and Deaths were persons diagnosed with COVID-19 while overseas, and who had died after returning to Singapore. These deaths will not be included as MOH\u2019s count only includes deaths from COVID-19 diagnosed in Singapore.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We expect to make annual adjustments to the COVID-19 death count in July, following the publication of the Report on Registration of Births and Deaths.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;<br>1 AUGUST 2022<br></strong><div><br></div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "update-to-the-number-of-local-covid-19-deaths-in-2021", "CurrentPageUrl": null, "CustomPressWidgetLocationUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
