and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

HEALTH ADVISORY
43.       Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province
and all non-essential travel to mainland China, Iran, northern Italy,
Japan and the Republic of Korea.
44.       All travellers should monitor their health closely for two
weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if
they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.
45.       Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
    respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

46.       MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical
practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely
to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
