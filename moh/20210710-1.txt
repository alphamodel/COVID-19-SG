Updates On Border Measures for Travellers From Indonesia



UPDATES ON BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM INDONESIA


Published Date: 10 Jul 2021

     The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the
global COVID-19 situation and regularly reviews Singaporeâ€™s border
measures to manage the risk of importation from travellers and onward
local transmission, taking into account the current situation in their
source countries/ regions.

TIGHTENING OF ENTRY APPROVALS FOR TRAVELLERS AND TRANSFERS FROM
INDONESIA

2.    Given the worsening situation in Indonesia, we will tighten our
border measures for travellers from Indonesia by reducing entry
approvals for non-Singapore Citizens/ Permanent Residents WITH IMMEDIATE
EFFECT. Entry approvals may be considered where additional safe
management measures are taken.
3.    With effect from 12 JULY 2021, 2359 HOURS, all travellers with
travel history to Indonesia within the last 21 days will also not be
allowed to transit through Singapore.

UPDATES IN PRE-DEPARTURE TESTING REQUIREMENTS

4.    Currently, all travellers entering Singapore with recent travel
history to INDONESIA within the last 21 days prior to departure for
Singapore will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) test taken within 72 hours before departure for
Singapore. With effect from 12 JULY 2021, 2359 HOURS, such travellers
will instead be required to present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test
taken within 48 hours before departure for Singapore.
5.    Travellers who arrive in Singapore without a valid negative PCR
test result may be denied entry into Singapore. Permanent Residents and
long-term pass holders who fail to comply with the new requirements may
have their permit or pass cancelled. All travellers will continue to be
subjected to:
        a.  14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities;
        b.  On-arrival PCR test[1] and PCR test on Day 14 of arrival;
and
        c.  On-arrival Antigen Rapid Test (ART)[2] and self-administered
ART test on Day 3, 7 and 11 of arrival.

REGULAR REVIEW OF BORDER MEASURES
6.    As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our
border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to
the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on
the SafeTravel website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to
check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and
be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon
entry.
