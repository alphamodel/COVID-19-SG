87 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 11 Sep 2020

            As of 11 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
has preliminarily confirmed an additional 87 cases of COVID-19 infection
in Singapore. Based on our investigations so far, there are no cases in
the community.

2.  There are 14 imported cases, who had all been placed on
Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.

3.  Amongst the 73 cases residing in dormitories today, 33
are from Avery Lodge Dormitory, the majority of whom had been placed on
quarantine earlier and were tested during quarantine to determine their
status. The remaining cases were detected through surveillance testing,
such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing. This allows us to pick
up cases in the dormitory early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we
are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission.

4.  We are still working through the details of the cases,
and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will
be issued tonight.
