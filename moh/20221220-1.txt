NATIONAL POPULATION HEALTH SURVEY 2021 HIGHLIGHTS NEED TO FOCUS ON PREVENTIVE HEALTH


Published Date: 20 Dec 2022

                 The National Population Health Survey (NPHS) 2021,
which tracks health and risk factors of Singapore residents aged 18 to
74 years for the period of July 2020 to June 2021, highlights the
increasing need for Singaporeans to look after their own health amidst
the backdrop of an ageing population.



2.  Self-reported (non-COVID-19) vaccination uptake,
particularly pneumococcal vaccination, increased significantly during
this period. The survey also found that more individuals were willing to
seek professional help for mental illnesses. However as the population
ages, fewer residents met the recommended level of physical activity in
2021, compared with 2019. There was also a drop in participation in
chronic disease and cancer screening, likely due to the COVID-19
pandemic.



UPTICK IN INFLUENZA VACCINATION AND PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION COVERAGE
AMONG SENIORS

_ _

3.  The NPHS 2021 showed a promising increase in uptake of
influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations amongst seniors. The proportion
of older residents aged 65 to 74 who had influenza vaccination rose from
24.2% in 2019 to 32.4% in 2021. The self-reported pneumococcal
vaccination coverage among seniors aged 65 to 74 years also increased
from 10.3% in 2019 to 22.4% in 2021.



4.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) will continue to partner
with healthcare professionals, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) and
other partners to encourage vaccinations under the National Adult
Immunisation Schedule (NAIS), to prevent serious complications and death
among high-risk groups such as the elderly and persons with certain
medical conditions.



MORE SOUGHT HELP ON MENTAL HEALTH



5.  The NPHS 2021 found that more people came forward to seek
professional help on mental health. A higher proportion of Singapore
residents were willing to seek help from healthcare professionals to
cope with stress in 2021 (58.3%) compared to 2019 (47.8%). This reflects
heightened public awareness of mental wellness, and reduced stigma
around mental conditions.



6.  Correspondingly, the proportion of Singapore residents
who were willing to seek help from informal support networks dropped
from 74.5% in 2019 to 69.1% in 2021. More effort is required to
strengthen informal and community support.



7.  We will continue to enhance community mental health
services, promote mental health awareness, enable early identification
and support timely assessment and interventions. Under the Community
Mental Health Masterplan, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC),
together with community partners, have set up community outreach teams
to reach out to and educate residents on mental health. In addition,
community intervention teams provide persons in mental distress with
counselling and psycho-social interventions. Mental health services are
also available in primary care to assess, diagnose and treat persons
with mental health conditions. Efforts to increase mental health
awareness and encourage help-seeking among peers, such as the SG Mental
Well-Being Network, are also ongoing.



8.  To oversee and coordinate mental health and well-being
efforts, the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being was
set up in July last year. A public consultation on the Taskforce’s
preliminary recommendations has recently concluded, and the feedback
received will be reviewed to refine the recommendations.



HEALTH SCREENING PARTICIPATION DECLINED, SELF-REPORTED CHRONIC DISEASE
PREVALENCE REMAINED STABLE



9.  Screening participation generally decreased in 2021
compared with 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be due to the
deferment of non-urgent services, which included screening services,
during the pandemic. Participation in chronic disease screening fell
from 66.3% in 2019 to 59.2% in 2021. Screening participation similarly
decreased for breast (from 38.7% to 31.1%), cervical (from 48.2% to
41.0%), and colorectal cancers (from 42.0% to 36.6%).

10.  About 7% of Singapore residents surveyed reported having
diabetes, about 14% reported having high blood cholesterol, and about
16% reported having hypertension. These self-reported figures are
comparable to 2019, but need to be treated with caution. Fewer persons
had gone for chronic disease screening during the COVID-19 pandemic, and
there could be significant levels of undiagnosed chronic conditions.



11.  We will continue to promote health screening, through the
Screen for Life programme. Healthier SG will fully fund nationally
recommended health screening when it is officially rolled out in the
second half of next year. These screenings include those for diabetes,
high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol, as well as three cancers
(breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers). We expect that screening
participation will be given a boost when Heathier SG is rolled out.

LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FELL AMIDST PANDEMIC



12.  We surveyed the prevalence of Singapore residents engaging
in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per
week, as a reflection of the desired sustained intensity of physical
activity. This figure decreased from 80.1% in 2019 to 71.1% in 2021,
likely a result of reduced social and physical activities during the
pandemic.



13.  While the proportion of Singapore residents engaging in
leisure-time regular exercise declined from 35.2% in 2019 to 32.5% in
2021, the decline was not statistically significant. Leisure-time
regular exercise was highest among young adults aged 18 to 29 years
(40.5%) and lowest among older adults aged 60 to 74 years (24.0%) in
2021.

14.  To encourage Singaporeans to be more active, we have
launched the Singapore Physical Activity Guidelines, and will continue
to improve accessibility to various exercise programmes, including
expanding the choices, bringing the programmes online and creating more
exercise sessions in community spaces. Through Healthier SG, we will
also encourage Singaporeans to lead more active lifestyles, and support
it by enhancing the National Steps Challenge.



SMOKING AND BINGE DRINKING REMAINED STABLE



15.  The prevalence of daily smoking for Singapore residents
remained stable at 10.4% in 2021, compared to 10.6% in 2019. Overall,
there is a sustained trend of decreasing smoking rates over the past
decade. The prevalence of binge drinking¹ also remained stable at 9.6%
in 2021, compared to 10.2% in 2019.

_ _

16.  We will continue our efforts to keep smoking prevalence
low. We will enhance educational efforts in schools to prevent smoking
initiation from young while continuing to help smokers quit through our
smoking cessation programmes. In addition, policies such as the Minimum
Legal Age 21 and standardised packaging for all tobacco products form
part of a multipronged approach to tobacco control, and reduce smoking
in the population.

_ _

17.  To target binge drinking, we will continue our educational
efforts in mainstream schools and Institutes of Higher Learning, and
through information on the harmful effects of alcohol consumption on
HealthHub.
