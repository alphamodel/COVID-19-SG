illness.
2.      There are 3 imported cases, who have already been placed on
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. 1 was

PROGRESS OF NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAMME
4.      As of 30 July 2021, 59% of our population has completed their
full regimen/ received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national
vaccination programme, and 77% has received at least one dose.  In
total, we have administered a total of 7,504,554 doses of COVID-19
vaccines under the national vaccination programme, covering 4,299,667
individuals, with 3,327,272 individuals having completed the full
vaccination regimen. In addition, 102,840 doses of Sinovac vaccines have
been administered as of 30 July 2021, covering 73,793 individuals.

CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.      604 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 33 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 7 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU). 3 amongst these 40 cases are fully
vaccinated. Of these, 2 require oxygen supplementation while 1 requires
ICU care as they have underlying medical conditions. 26 seniors above 60
years, of whom 24 are completely unvaccinated or partially vaccinated,
have fallen very ill.

6.      There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 49 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 28 are unvaccinated, 18 are partially vaccinated and 3 are fully
vaccinated.

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES
7.      Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased
from 1,027 cases in the week before to 868 cases in the past week. We
are likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as
we step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the
community. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased
from 99 cases in the week before to 273 cases in the past week. The
7-day moving average number of all linked community cases and all
unlinked community cases are 85.0 and 39.0 respectively.

arrival in Singapore, while 2 developed the illness during SHN or
isolation.

ACTIVE CLUSTERS UNDER MONITORING
9.      There are 8 new clusters today. In total, there are currently 71
active clusters, ranging between 3 and 1,027 infections. MOH has been
monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have
been no more cases linked to the Changi General Hospital cluster for the
past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been
closed.

Collection of ART self-test kits for visitors to selected markets and
food centres
10.     MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
markets and food centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who
visited Jurong Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the
markets and food centres. As an added layer of ringfencing to help to
identify cases and prevent further transmission, MOH is working with the
People’s Association to distribute antigen rapid test (ART) self-test
kits to individuals who had visited selected markets and food centres in
the last 14 days, such as residents living in the vicinity of these
centres. The collection will run from 1 to 2 August 2021 at Residents’
Committee Centres in the vicinity of the following locations:

-   497 Jurong West Street 41 Market; and

-   Fajar Market (445 Fajar Rd)

11.     Eligible persons are strongly encouraged to collect and perform
self-testing using these ART kits. Please refer
to https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/art to check on the nearest Residents’
Committee Centre for self-collection.
12.     Please refer to MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
