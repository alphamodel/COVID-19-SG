from 2 cases in the week before to none in the past week. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from 2 cases in the
week before to none in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.

3.    Amongst the 93 confirmed cases reported from 17 March to 23 March,
32 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 46 have tested
negative, and 15 serology test results are pending.

CASE DETAILS

A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0

There are no cases in the community today.

B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.

C) IMPORTED CASES: 13

Amongst the 13 imported cases,

-   3 (Cases 61116, 61117 and 61118) are Singaporeans and 2 (Cases 61108
    and 61115) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from
    Austria, India, Malaysia and the US.
-   1 (Case 61110) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from India.
-   1 (Case 61120) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from the US.
-   5 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and the
    Philippines, of whom 1 (Case 61125) is a foreign domestic worker.
-   1 (Case 61121) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
    the UAE for a work project in Singapore.

They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
Case 61118 is a 40 year-old female Singaporean who had been residing in
Austria since August 2019. She returned to Singapore on 2 March 2021,
and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 16 March. Both her
on-arrival test on 2 March, as well as her swab done on 15 March during
SHN, were negative for COVID-19. She is asymptomatic, and was detected
when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 20 March in preparation
for a trip to Indonesia. Her test result came back positive on 22 March,
and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Her
Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and her
serology test result has also come back positive. Given that these
indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported
based on her travel history. She is likely to be shedding minute
fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and
infective to others.

4.   Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.   Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
6.    Low levels of COVID-19 viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) were detected
on 21 March from the National Environment Agency’s testing of wastewater
sample collected on 20 March from the UTown Residence North Tower at the
National University of Singapore. There is evidence to suggest that this
may be due to viral shedding from a recovered past infection amongst the
residents, but as a precautionary measure, MOH carried out a special
testing operations today to test residents of the affected apartments.
In total, 437 individuals, excluding the recovered case, have been
swabbed for COVID-19 during the testing operations, and all the results
are currently pending.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.   12 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,063 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.    There are currently 25 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 103 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
