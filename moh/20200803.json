The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c)&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;<strong>Cases residing in dormitories: 216&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"></span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br></span></span><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">2.</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
