+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+



A)  IMPORTED CASES: 10 (7 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1
Dependant’s Pass holder, 1 Long-Term Visit Pass holder, 1 Short-Term
Visit Pass holder)

Amongst the 10 imported cases, 7 (Cases 56694, 56695, 56696, 56697,
56704, 56745 and 56750) are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who
returned to Singapore from India between 16 August and 18 August.
Another 2 (Cases 56685 and 56690) are Dependant’s Pass and Long-Term
Pass holders who arrived from India on 12 August and 16 August. All of
them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in
Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at dedicated
facilities.

The remaining case (Case 56726) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who
was allowed entry into Singapore as she has been seeking medical
treatment here. She was conveyed directly to the hospital upon arrival
in Singapore.



B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 4 (4 Singaporeans)

Of the 4 cases in the community, 3 had already been placed on quarantine
earlier. 1 of the cases is asymptomatic, and was detected through our
proactive testing.

3 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases. Cases
56743, 56744 and 56746 had been identified as contacts of previously
confirmed cases, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. They were
tested during quarantine to determine their status.

There is 1 case in the community who is currently unlinked. Case 56740
was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to
identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further
spread.

Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for her household contacts to
determine if she could have been infected by them.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.



C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 80

Amongst the 80 cases residing in dormitories, 70 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.

The remaining 10 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with ARI symptoms. This allows us to
pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to
ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively
containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.

58 of the cases residing in dormitories today are from Sungei Tengah
Lodge, who had all been placed on quarantine earlier. The vast majority
of them were tested during quarantine to determine their status, or
picked up through Rostered Routine Testing. Following the detection of
cases at Sungei Tengah Lodge¹, we had placed about 4,500 workers on
quarantine, and tested about 3,000 of them so far. We expect the number
of cases from the dormitory to continue to be high in the coming days as
we complete testing of the remaining quarantined workers.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of the cases residing in
dormitories are current or past infections.² The serological test
results for 8 cases have come back positive so far, which indicate
likely past infections.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.  Of the new cases, 97% are imported or linked to known
cases/ clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.

4.  MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Bukit Panjang
Integrated Transport Hub (15 Petir Road) for the past two incubation
periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

5.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

6.  198 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 55,337 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

7.  There are currently 71 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 1,231 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.



MINISTRY OF HEALTH
28 AUGUST 2020

[1] Sungei Tengah Lodge was reported as a new cluster by MOH on 22
August 2020.
[2] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
