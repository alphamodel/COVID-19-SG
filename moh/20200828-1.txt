94 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 28 Aug 2020

          As of 28 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 94 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. Based on our investigations so far, there are 4 cases in the
community, all of whom are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents.

2.  There are 10 imported cases, who had all been placed on
Stay-Home Notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore.

3.  Amongst the 80 cases residing in dormitories today, 58 are
from Sungei Tengah Lodge, who had all been placed on quarantine earlier.
The vast majority of them were tested during quarantine to determine
their status, or picked up through Rostered Routine Testing. Following
the detection of cases at Sungei Tengah Lodge, we had placed about 4,500
workers on quarantine, and tested about 3,000 of them so far. We expect
the number of cases from the dormitory to continue to be high in the
coming days as we complete testing of the remaining quarantined workers.

4.  We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
