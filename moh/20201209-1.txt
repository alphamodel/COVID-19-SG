3.   Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4.   Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.

UPDATE ON CASE FROM ROYAL CARIBBEAN INTERNATIONAL’S _QUANTUM OF THE
SEAS
_5_.   _An 83 year-old male Singaporean on board Royal Caribbean
International’s _Quantum of the Seas_ tested positive for COVID-19
infection this morning, and was immediately isolated. He had reported to
the medical centre with diarrhoea, and as part of the protocols was
tested for COVID-19 using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test
equipment on board the ship. His original sample has since been
re-tested at the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), and has come
back negative for COVID-19 infection. A second fresh sample tested by
NPHL has also come back negative. NPHL will conduct another test
tomorrow to confirm his COVID-19 status.
6.   In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have
been isolated as a precautionary measure. As part of the routine
post-arrival protocols, all passengers will undergo mandatory COVID-19
testing before they are allowed to leave the terminal at Marina Bay
Cruise Centre.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.   6 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,182 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.   There are currently 20 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 60 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
