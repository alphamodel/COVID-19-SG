    <body><h1>First Shipment of Nuvaxovid Covid-19 Vaccine  Has Arrived In Singapore</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 04 May 2022</p> <p style="margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first shipment of Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine (Nuvaxovid) by Novavax has arrived in Singapore on 4 May 2022. This will enable us to start offering the&nbsp;Nuvaxovid vaccine at our first&nbsp;Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre&nbsp;(JTVC)&nbsp;at the former Bishan Park Secondary School, as well as 20 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs)&nbsp;at the end of this month.<br><br>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Slated for operations in end-May 2022, the JTVCs will be a new class of facilities which will offer both COVID-19 testing and vaccination services in the same premise. The JTVCs will allow us to consolidate our resources, while ensuring testing and vaccination services remain accessible to the public. We are also working to onboard selected PHPCs to offer the Nuvaxovid vaccine. Further details will be announced in the coming weeks.&nbsp;<br><br>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">On 14 February 2022, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce accepted the recommendation of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) to include the Nuvaxovid vaccine in the National Vaccination Programme for use in individuals aged 18 years and above, for both COVID-19 primary series and booster vaccination.<br><br>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Having considered the data on its safety, efficacy and tolerability, the EC19V recommends the Nuvaxovid vaccine as an acceptable alternative to the mRNA vaccines in individuals aged 18 years and above, although the mRNA vaccines still remain the preferred vaccines due to their higher efficacy and the stronger immune response generated.<br><br>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Boosters and vaccinations remain a critical part of our COVID-19 strategy in ensuring our population is well protected against infection and severe illness. We urge all who are eligible for vaccinations and booster doses to receive them as soon as possible.<br></span><strong style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; text-align: left;"><br>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; text-align: left;">4 MAY 2022</strong></p><div></div><p style="margin-left: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;"><br></span></p></body>
