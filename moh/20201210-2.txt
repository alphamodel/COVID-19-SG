NO NEW CASES OF LOCALLY TRANSMITTED COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 10 Dec 2020

  As of 10 December 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed that there are no new cases of locally
transmitted COVID-19 infection.
2.   There are 6 imported cases, who had already been placed on
Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.
3.  We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
4.  A final confirmatory test conducted by the National Public
Health Laboratory (NPHL) on 10 December 2020 has confirmed that the 83
year-old male Singaporean on board Royal Caribbean Internationalâ€™s
Quantum of the Seas does not have COVID-19 infection. The sample taken
from the individual this morning came back negative for the virus. This
follows two Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests conducted yesterday by
NPHL, one on a re-test of his original sample, and the other on a fresh
sample taken yesterday, which had also come back negative. We have
rescinded the Quarantine Orders of his close contacts, who had earlier
been placed on quarantine as a precautionary measure while
investigations were ongoing. MOH will support the laboratory on board
the Quantum of the Seas in its review of its testing processes.
