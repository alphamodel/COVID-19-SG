A) IMPORTED CASES: 4 (1 Work Pass holder, 1 Work Permit holder, 1
Dependant’s Pass holder, 1 Student’s Pass holder)
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 2 (Cases 57708 and 57710) are Work Pass/
Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from the
Philippines on 8 September. Another case (Case 57706) is a Dependant’s
Pass holder who arrived from Iran on 15 September and the remaining case
(Case 57707) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from Germany on 9
September.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Work Permit holder)
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
57718 was detected from our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the
construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the
dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic.
Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the
meantime, all his identified close contacts have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for his household contacts to determine if he
could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked
cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of fewer
than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 13
Amongst the 13 cases residing in dormitories, 5 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 8 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
2.      Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 72% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

5.      39 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,181 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.

6.      There are currently 30 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 338 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
