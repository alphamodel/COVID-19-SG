Published Date: 09 Aug 2021

         We have made good progress in our national COVID-19 vaccination
programme thus far. As of 8 August 2021, 70% of the population have
completed their full vaccination regimen under the national vaccination
programme and 79% of the population have received at least one dose.
2.      Since mid-July, seniors aged 60 and above have been allowed to
walk into any vaccination centre, polyclinic or participating Public
Health Preparedness Clinic to receive their vaccination without an
appointment. From 2 August, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents, and
Long-Term Pass holders aged 18 years old and above have also been
allowed to walk in to any of our 11 community vaccination centres
offering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine without a prior appointment.
3.      From 10 August 2021, to make it more convenient to get
vaccinated, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass
holders aged 12 years old and above who have yet to come forward for
their first dose will be able to walk in to any of the 26 vaccination
centres offering the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine without
a prior appointment.
4.      Vaccination remains a key enabler in our fight against COVID-19.
We urge all who are eligible to be vaccinated. Individuals can also
continue to book appointments at http://www.vaccine.gov.sg to get
vaccinated.
