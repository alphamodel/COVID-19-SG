No New Cases of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection



NO NEW CASES OF LOCALLY TRANSMITTED COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 16 Feb 2021

1.     As of 16 February 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed that there are no new cases of locally
transmitted COVID-19 infection.

2.     There is 1 imported case, who had already been placed on
Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.

3.     From 5 February, newly arrived Work Permit and S Pass holders in
the Construction, Marine and Process sectors, foreign domestic workers
and confinement nannies, who have recent travel history to higher-risk
countries/ regions, are progressively required to undergo mandatory
on-arrival polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology tests. These
have enabled us to quickly identify persons who have recovered from an
old COVID-19 infection, and are no longer infective to others by the
time they arrived in Singapore, and to exclude them from our daily case
count.

4.     We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
