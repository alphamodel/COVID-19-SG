with 4,011,715 individuals having completed the full vaccination
regimen.
2.      In addition, 142,966 doses of other vaccines recognised in the
World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been
administered as of 12 August 2021, covering 82,951 individuals. In

30 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 10 in
critical condition in the ICU. 7 amongst these 40 cases are fully
vaccinated. Of those who have fallen very ill, 34 are seniors above 60
years, of whom 27 are completely unvaccinated or partially vaccinated.
4.      Case 66875, an 84 year-old male Singaporean, has passed away
from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 13 August 2021. He had
developed symptoms on 28 July, and was admitted to National University
Hospital on 29 July where he tested positive for COVID-19 infection. He
had not been vaccinated against COVID-19, and had a history of cancer,
ischaemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and

5.     There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 9.6%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 1.0%.

total population who received at least 1 dose and about 1% of total
population who completed the full regimen.
[4] Fully vaccinated - more than 14 days after completing vaccination
