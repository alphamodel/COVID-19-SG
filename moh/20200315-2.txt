59.  Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

·  Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing
symptoms of illness; ·  Observe good personal hygiene;

respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
·  Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough
or shortness of breath;
·  Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or
sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin
