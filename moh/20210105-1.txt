CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2
There are 2 cases in the community today, of whom 1 is currently
unlinked and the other is linked to previous cases.
Case 58981
Case 58981, a 49 year-old male Indian national, is a Short-Term Visit
Pass holder who is here to visit his Singaporean spouse. He arrived from
India on 10 December 2020, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until
24 December. His pre-departure test taken in India on 6 December was
negative for COVID-19 infection, and his test on 21 December during SHN
came back negative as well.
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 3 January in preparation for his return to India.
His result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and he
was conveyed to Mount Elizabeth Hospital. His serological test result
has come back positive, which indicates a likely past infection.
Case 58997
Case 58997 is a 55 year-old male Singaporean who works as a cargo
officer. He was on board bunker tanker NewOcean 6 from 21 December to 23
December, and from 28 December to 2 January. From 23 December to 28
December, he stayed at his home at Tah Ching Road.
His earlier tests from Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) – the last being
on 23 December – had been negative for COVID-19 infection.
On 31 December, he was placed on quarantine as he had been identified as
a close contact of a previously reported case (Case 58812 ) who is a
crew member of the same vessel. Case 58997 was conveyed to a government
quarantine facility on 2 January, and tested positive for COVID-19
infection on 3 January. He was then conveyed to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. His serological test result has come back negative,
indicating that this is likely a current infection.
All the remaining crew members of the vessel have been placed on
quarantine since 31 December.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 26
