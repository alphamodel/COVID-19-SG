The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from 5 cases in the week before to 4 cases in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>Case Details</strong><br><br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 4</strong><br><br>There are 4 cases in the community today, of whom 2 are currently unlinked and 2 are linked to previous cases.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Case 59340</span><br><br>Case 59340 is a 39 year-old male Singaporean who works at Singapore Scouts Association (1 Bishan Street 12), handling mainly administrative work in the office.

His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.

His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 17 December – were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.<br><br>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family and household members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 19</strong><br><br>Amongst the 19 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>• 1 (Case 59339) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from India.<br>• 3 (Cases 59329, 59331 and 59332) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from the UAE and India.<br>• 2 (Cases 59327 and 59330) are Student’s Pass holders who arrived from India and France.&nbsp;<br>• 5 (Cases 59328, 59337, 59341, 59342 and 59348) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India, Japan, Spain and the UAE.&nbsp;<br>• 6 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India and Myanmar, of whom 3 (Cases 59333, 59335 and 59336) are foreign domestic workers.<br>• 1 (Case 59346) is a sea crew holding a Special Pass who arrived from Brunei onboard a vessel on 5 January and had not disembarked.

Their swabs done on 5 January during SHN were negative for COVID-19, and subsequent tests on 9 January and 11 January were also negative. Their tests on 14 January came back positive for COVID-19 infection, although the Ct values were very high, which are indicative of low viral loads. Their serological test results have also come back positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have classified these cases as imported. They are likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annexesc1d1cad3fc8c4266b28168000969b17f.pdf?sfvrsn=910a9d7e_0" title="Annexes">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH’s daily Situation Report (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;13 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,784 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are currently 54 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 216 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The recent locally transmitted cases are a stark reminder that we cannot afford to let our guard down. We must continue to keep up our discipline in adhering to the safe management and safe distancing measures, so as to avoid an uncontrolled resurgence of cases that may necessitate a tightening of measures.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>16 JANUARY 2021</strong><br></span></p><div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><br></span></div></body>
