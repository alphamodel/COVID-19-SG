The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from none in the week before to 3 cases in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amongst the 200 confirmed cases reported from 30 January to 5 February, 114 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 34 have tested negative, and 52 serology test results are pending.<br><br><strong>Case Details</strong><br><br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 1</strong><br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.&nbsp;<br><br>Case 59980 is a 56 year-old male Singaporean who works as an import officer at Yusen Logistics and is based at Changi Cargo Megaplex 1 (119 Airport Cargo Road). His job does not entail interaction with flight passengers.&nbsp;<br><br>He developed a cough on 2 February but did not seek medical attention and continued to go to work. As he had been identified earlier as a contact of a tuberculosis (TB) case at his workplace, he went to the Tuberculosis Control Unit on 4 February for TB screening. There, he was tested for COVID-19 after he reported his symptoms.&nbsp;<br><br>His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier test from a testing operation of airport cargo workers on 18 January had been negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 1</strong><br><br>There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today.&nbsp;<br><br>Case 59966, a 31 year-old male Bangladesh national, is a Work Pass holder who arrived in Singapore on 13 December 2020, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 27 December. His swab done on 23 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>He is asymptomatic, and was detected when his test taken on 4 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) came back positive for COVID-19 infection. His earlier test from RRT on 13 January was negative for COVID-19. His serology test has come back positive, but given the relatively long time interval between his travel and positive COVID-19 test, we have classified this case as locally transmitted.<br><br>He has not started work since arriving in Singapore, and stays at a dormitory located at 1 Soon Lee Street.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 23</strong><br><br>Amongst the 23 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>\u2022 3 (Cases 59968, 59969 and 59988) are Singaporeans and 2 (Cases 59981 and 59991) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from Canada, India, Iran and the UAE.<br>\u2022 2 (Cases 59970 and 59977) are Dependant\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from India and the UAE.<br>\u2022 4 (Cases 59967, 59990, 59993 and 59994) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India, Russia and the UAE.<br>\u2022 11 (Cases 59971, 59974, 59975, 59976, 59982, 59983, 59984, 59986, 59987, 59989 and 59992) are Work Permit holders who arrived from Indonesia and Myanmar, all of whom are foreign domestic workers.<br>\u2022 1 (Case 59973) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from the Netherlands for a work project in Singapore.<br><br>They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family and household members, as well as co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annexes47bbc840812b40ab8024ee5019dfc8b6.pdf?sfvrsn=bb5bd5e1_0\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 25 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
