First Shipment of Nuvaxovid Covid-19 Vaccine Has Arrived In Singapore



FIRST SHIPMENT OF NUVAXOVID COVID-19 VACCINE HAS ARRIVED IN SINGAPORE


Published Date: 04 May 2022

   The first shipment of Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine (Nuvaxovid) by
Novavax has arrived in Singapore on 4 May 2022. This will enable us to
start offering the Nuvaxovid vaccine at our first Joint Testing and
Vaccination Centre (JTVC) at the former Bishan Park Secondary School, as
well as 20 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) at the end of this
month.
2.  Slated for operations in end-May 2022, the JTVCs will be a new
class of facilities which will offer both COVID-19 testing and
vaccination services in the same premise. The JTVCs will allow us to
consolidate our resources, while ensuring testing and vaccination
services remain accessible to the public. We are also working to onboard
selected PHPCs to offer the Nuvaxovid vaccine. Further details will be
announced in the coming weeks.
3.  On 14 February 2022, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce accepted the
recommendation of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V)
to include the Nuvaxovid vaccine in the National Vaccination Programme
for use in individuals aged 18 years and above, for both COVID-19
primary series and booster vaccination.
4.  Having considered the data on its safety, efficacy and
tolerability, the EC19V recommends the Nuvaxovid vaccine as an
acceptable alternative to the mRNA vaccines in individuals aged 18 years
and above, although the mRNA vaccines still remain the preferred
vaccines due to their higher efficacy and the stronger immune response
generated.
5.  Boosters and vaccinations remain a critical part of our COVID-19
strategy in ensuring our population is well protected against infection
and severe illness. We urge all who are eligible for vaccinations and
booster doses to receive them as soon as possible.
