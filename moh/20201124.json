As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at Cassia @ Penjuru (15 Penjuru Walk) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed. With the closure of this cluster, there are no active COVID-19 clusters for the first time since 3 February 2020.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
