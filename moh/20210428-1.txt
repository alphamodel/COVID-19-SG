CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3
There are 3 cases in the community today who are currently unlinked.
Case 62517
Case 62517 is a 38 year-old male Singaporean who works as an Immigration
& Checkpoints Authority (ICA) Officer deployed at Changi Airport
Terminal 1, but had not gone to work after onset of symptoms.
He developed a cough on 23 April and sought medical treatment the next
day at a General Practitioner clinic, where he was given 2 days’ medical
leave. On 26 April, he developed a fever, anosmia and body aches, and
sought medical treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital the next day. He was
tested for COVID-19 and his test came back positive on the same day. His
previous tests from RRT – the last being on 22 April – were all negative
for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result is pending.
Case 62526
Case 62526 is a 58 year-old male Singaporean who works as a construction
project manager in Nepal, and had been in there from 13 February to 13
December 2020.
Upon his return to Singapore, he served SHN at a dedicated facility
until 27 December. His test taken on 23 December during SHN was negative
for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a
COVID-19 pre-departure test on 26 April in preparation for his trip back
to Nepal. His test result came back positive the next day, and he was
conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in an
ambulance. His serology test result is pending.
His Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load. He
could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past
infection which are no longer transmissible and infective to others, but
given that we are not able to definitively conclude when he had been
infected, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a
precautionary measure.
Case 62541
Case 62541 is a 46 year-old female Philippines national who is a nurse
at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), and is deployed at Ward 9D, a general
ward.
She developed a cough, sore throat and body aches on 27 April, and
sought medical treatment at TTSH. Her test result came back positive for
COVID-19 infection on the same day, and she was warded at NCID. Her
serology test result is pending.
Case 62541 received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 26 January,
and the second dose on 18 February. The COVID-19 vaccine is effective in
preventing symptomatic disease for the vast majority of those
vaccinated, but it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get
infected.
Following the detection of Case 62541, TTSH has locked down the affected
ward, and tested the patients and staff who had been in the ward. So
far, we have detected 4 more cases who have tested preliminarily
positive for COVID-19 infection. These include a doctor, and 3 patients
who are being cared for in the same ward. As a precautionary measure,
all staff who treated the infected patients, as well as all visitors,
patients and staff working in Ward 9D will be placed on quarantine.
Epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are ongoing. As we
are conducting further testing for these 4 cases, they have not been
included in today’s case count.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.

4.      Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.      Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.      14 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,718 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or

hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 226 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
