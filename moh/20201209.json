He had reported to the medical centre with diarrhoea, and as part of the protocols was tested for COVID-19 using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test equipment on board the ship. His original sample has since been re-tested at the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), and has come back negative for COVID-19 infection. A second fresh sample tested by NPHL has also come back negative. NPHL will conduct another test tomorrow to confirm his COVID-19 status. <br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been isolated as a precautionary measure. As part of the routine post-arrival protocols, all passengers will undergo mandatory COVID-19 testing before they are allowed to leave the terminal at Marina Bay Cruise Centre.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases&nbsp;<br><br></strong>7.<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>6 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,182 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities. <br><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are currently 20 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 60 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.</p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>9 DECEMBER 2020</strong></p> </div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "no-new-cases-of-locally-transmitted-covid-19-infection-9decfullpr", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "No New Cases of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1607504400000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "09 Dec 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p>As of 9 December 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed that there are no new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. <br><br>There are 6 imported cases, who had already been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore. <br><br>We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight. <br><br>An 83 year-old male Singaporean on board Royal Caribbean International\u2019s <em>Quantum of the Seas</em> tested positive for COVID-19 infection this morning, and was immediately isolated.
