Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.

5.  Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

6.  COVID-19 viral fragments were detected on 21 March from
testing of wastewater sample collected on 20 March from the UTown
Residence North Tower at the National University of Singapore. There is
evidence to suggest that this may be due to viral shedding from a
recovered past infection amongst the residents, but as a precautionary
measure, MOH carried out a special testing operations to test residents
of the affected apartments. In total, 438 individuals, excluding the
recovered case, were swabbed. 437 results have come back negative for
COVID-19 infection, and 1 is pending.
