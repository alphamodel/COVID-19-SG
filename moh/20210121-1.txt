CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 4
There are 4 cases in the community today, of whom 1 is currently
unlinked and 3 are linked to previous cases.
Case 59512
Case 59512 is a 43 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case
59429¹. She works from home as an online trader and does not physically
interact with her clients.
She was placed on quarantine on 18 January when Case 59429 was confirmed
to have COVID-19 infection. On 20 January, she was tested for COVID-19
even though she is asymptomatic. Her test came back positive on the same
day, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases
(NCID). Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that
this is likely a current infection.
Case 59513
Case 59513 is a 46 year-old female Malaysian national who is a Work Pass
holder. She works as a sales personnel at Toppan Merrill Pte Ltd (3
Church Street) but does not interact with clients. She is a household
contact of Case 59474².
She developed a blocked nose on 19 January and stayed at home for most
of the day. As she had been identified as a close contact of Case 59474,
she was contacted by MOH on 20 January and placed on quarantine. She
reported her symptoms and was conveyed to Sengkang General Hospital
where she was tested for COVID-19. Her test came back positive on the
same day. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating
that this is likely a current infection.
Case 59516
Case 59516 is a 35 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who works
as a sales personnel at BS Industrial & Construction Supply Pte Ltd (34
Kallang Place). He is a co-worker of Case 59429.
He developed a sore throat on 18 January but did not seek medical
treatment. As he had been identified as a close contact of Case 59429,
he was contacted by MOH on the same day but failed to report his
symptom. On 20 January, he was tested for COVID-19 while under
quarantine. His result came back positive on the same day, and he was
subsequently conveyed to the National University Hospital. His serology
test result is pending.
Case 59518
Case 59518 is a 42 year-old male Singaporean who works as a dive
personnel at Ocean Works Asia Pte Ltd (Block 6, 13 Jalan Terusan).
He had travelled to Indonesia for work between 4 November and 13
December 2020, and served SHN at a dedicated facility upon his return to
Singapore until 27 December. His swab done on 24 December during SHN was
negative for COVID- 19.
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19 test on 20
January as part of the requirement for shore-based personnel going
onboard a vessel to be tested. His result came back positive for
COVID-19 infection on the same day and he was conveyed to NCID. His
serological test result has come back positive, which indicates a likely
past infection.
Given the relatively long time interval between his travel and positive
COVID-19 test, we have classified this case as locally transmitted.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family and
household members, as well as co-workers, have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
case could have been infected by them.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 34
Amongst the 34 imported cases,
• 1 (Case 59517) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from the
US.
• 1 (Case 59501) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from the UAE.
• 1 (Case 59497) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from the
US.
• 2 (Cases 59486 and 59487) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India
and the UAE.
• 26 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and
Indonesia, of whom 1 (Case 59503) is a foreign domestic worker.
• 1 (Case 59514) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
India to visit her child who is a Singapore Permanent Resident.
• 2 (Cases 59479 and 59515) are Special Pass holders who are sea crew.
Case 59479 arrived from Indonesia to board a vessel docked in Singapore,
and Case 59515 arrived onboard a vessel from Indonesia and had not
disembarked. He was tested for COVID-19, and conveyed to the hospital
when his result came back positive.
Of the 34 cases, 33 had already been placed on SHN or isolated upon
arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or while under
isolation.
Case 59517 is a Singapore Permanent Resident who arrived from the US on
17 January for work purposes, and was tested for COVID-19 upon arrival.
His test came back negative on the same day, and he was on a controlled
itinerary for the next few days. On 20 January, he took a COVID-19
pre-departure test in preparation for a trip to the UK. His result came
back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day and he was conveyed
to the hospital.
Case 59511 is a Work Permit holder who arrived from India on 27 December
2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 10 January 2021. His
swab done on 7 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19, and
subsequent tests on 11 January and 13 January were also negative. His
test on 19 January came back positive for COVID-19 infection, although
the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load. His
serological test result has also come back positive. Given that these
indicate likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported.
He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are
no longer transmissible and infective to others.
