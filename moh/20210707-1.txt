125 Nurses Recognised With Nurses' Merit Award



125 NURSES RECOGNISED WITH NURSES' MERIT AWARD


Published Date: 07 Jul 2021

       125 nurses were presented with the Nurses’ Merit Award (NMA) on 7
July 2021. The award recipients come from various care settings,
spanning the community care sector, private hospitals and public
healthcare institutions.
2.    The NMA started in 1976 and is awarded to nurses who have
displayed noteworthy and exceptional performance, participated in
professional development, and contributed to raising the nursing
profession. Nurses are nominated for the award by their healthcare
institutions and selected by a panel set up by the Ministry of Health
(MOH).
3.    The award comes with a collar badge to be worn as part of the
nurse’s uniform and a cash prize of $1,000. See Annex A for the list of
award recipients.
STRENGTHENING CONTINUED LEARNING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR NURSES
4.    As we continue to expand our healthcare sector, our nursing
workforce continues to grow. As at end 2020, more than 42,000 nurses are
registered with the Singapore Nursing Board (SNB). Over the years, MOH
has put in place various initiatives and programmes to enhance the
professional development opportunities and career advancement of our
nurses. At the virtual award ceremony, Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung
elaborated further on these initiatives.
Developing Competency Frameworks
5.    Following the launch of the Community Nursing Competency Framework
(CNCF) last year, two other competency frameworks will be developed to
meet the growing needs of the ageing population in Singapore – one for
geriatric nursing, and another for palliative care nursing. The
competency frameworks will serve as a guide for nurses and employers to
identify skills gaps and pursue development opportunities.
National Nursing Academy
6.    We are expanding the opportunities for continuous professional
development, for our nurses. The National Nursing Academy (NNA) launched
last year allows nurses to explore and attend training courses from
other institutions, and facilitate portability of workplace-based
training of nurses across institutions and settings. This would
encourage collaboration amongst healthcare institutions, synergise
efforts and reduce duplication.
7.    As of April 2021, a total of 58 workplace-based and academic
nursing Continuous Education and Training (CET) courses have been listed
on the NNA website. Nurses can discuss with their supervisors to explore
learning opportunities if they are keen to learn certain clinical skills
and expand knowledge in areas they want to develop further.
8.    The NNA also seeks to standardise curriculum requirements to share
best practices and harmonise existing curricula at various institutions
through the establishment of curricula blueprints. Currently, the
blueprint for two core skills required of nurses working across
different healthcare settings have been developed in consultation with
healthcare institutions: 1) Intravenous Administration of Medications
(IVAM), and 2) Venepuncture and Peripheral Intravenous Cannulation
(VPIC). The curricula blueprints are accessible at
https://www.nna.gov.sg/resources-tools/downloads.
9.    In May 2021, the NNA completed its inaugural course accreditation,
where JurongHealth Campus’s IVAM and VPIC courses were accredited.
Courses that meet the NNA’s accreditation standards support the
portability of acquired competencies across healthcare institutions.
More courses will be accredited over time. To find out more about the
course listings including the NNA-accredited courses, please visit

Integrated Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) Internship Programme and APN
faculty development
10.    MOH will continue to strengthen training for Advanced Practice
Nurses (APNs). The APN internship programme, which forms part of the
training for APNs, undergoes regular reviews to ensure its training
methods and curriculum delivery encourage optimal learning. This year,
we will introduce a new Integrated APN Internship Programme (IAI), which
will begin with the graduating cohort in August, to facilitate an early
integration of Master of Nursing graduates to their respective areas of
clinical practice.
11.    In the new programme, the APN interns will be trained in a
systematic and progressive method based on a blueprint and the use of
Entrustable Professional Activities. These are key tasks that the APN
intern can be trusted to perform once sufficient competence has been
demonstrated at the workplace. Work-based assessments will then form the
requirement towards the APN certification.
12.    Interns who are progressing well will also have the option to
enroll into the National Collaborative Prescribing Programme and
graduate from the programme as a full-fledged APN with prescribing
rights, to prescribe medication to patients within their scope of
practice.
13.    Traditionally, much of the APN teaching and training have been
largely dependent on doctors. In preparation for the Integrated APN
Internship programme, MOH has facilitated the progressive training and
development of a faculty of APN Leads and Preceptors across healthcare
institutions. As of May this year, 180 APNs have been trained as
preceptors to provide clinical preceptorship and supervision to APN
interns and students from the Master of Nursing programme. These APN
Leads and Preceptors will co-precept with the doctors and be more
involved in the teaching, supervision and assessment of the APN
interns.
14.    MOH will continue to develop the nursing profession by creating
opportunities for nurses to upskill and enhance their professional
development throughout their nursing careers.
