UPDATE ON VACCINATION PROGRESS
        As of 3 September 2021, we have administered a total of
8,765,482 doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination
programme (Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty and Moderna), covering 4,527,338
individuals, with 4,357,467 individuals having completed the full
vaccination regimen.
2.     In addition, 170,144 doses of other vaccines recognised in the
World Health Organization's Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been
administered as of 3 September 2021, covering 86,019 individuals. In
total, 81% of our population has completed their full regimen/ received
two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 83% has received at least one dose.

3.     608 cases are currently warded in hospital. There are currently
22 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 5 in
critical condition in the ICU. Of those who have fallen very ill, 22 are

4.     There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 7.1%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 1.1%.
