This is close to a third of the community cases for the past two days, which is highly encouraging, as we see more individuals taking personal empowerment to take care of their own health and recovery.

Hence, we will be further expanding the suitability criteria for Home Recovery to now include fully vaccinated individuals up to the age of 69 years. This allows more COVID-19 patients to recover within the comfort of their homes, and for us to further direct our hospitals resources to those who really need more intensive care.&nbsp;<br><br>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">From&nbsp;<strong>18 September 2021</strong>,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Home Recovery will be the default care management model for individuals who are:<br></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">a. &nbsp;Fully vaccinated;<br>b. &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Aged 12 to 69 years old;<br>c. &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">No severe co-morbidities or illnesses;&nbsp;<br>d. &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Able to self-isolate in a room, preferably with an attached bathroom; and<br>e. &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Have no household members who are more than 80 years old or are in one of the vulnerable groups (e.g. pregnant individuals or with weakened immune response).</span></p></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">12. &nbsp; Individuals tested positive for COVID-19 and meet the above criteria can begin Home Recovery immediately, without having to be conveyed to a hospital or Community Care Facility.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">We continue to urge all fully vaccinated COVID-19 individuals below the age of 70 to adopt Home Recovery as the default care management, just like how you would recover from, say, Influenza.
