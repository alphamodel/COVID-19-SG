Province and all non-essential travel to mainland China, Iran, northern
Italy, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
38.            All travellers should monitor their health closely for
two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly
if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their
travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g.
cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic
ahead of the visit.
39.          Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:
·      Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing
symptoms of illness;
·      Observe good personal hygiene;
·      Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling
food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
·      Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
shortness of breath;
·      Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing,
and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
·      Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.
40.          MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is
likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
