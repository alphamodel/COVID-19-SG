The FIF aims to fill critical financing PPR gaps and promote a more coordinated approach to PPR investments. It will value-add to existing work to catalyse domestic investments in low- and lower-middle-income countries, as well as build pandemic PPR capacities at the regional and global levels. The European Commission, Germany, Indonesia, and the United States have pledged contributions to the FIF.</span><br style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-align: justify;\">3.

The patient is a&nbsp;42-year-old&nbsp;male&nbsp;British&nbsp;national&nbsp;who&nbsp;works as a flight&nbsp;attendant&nbsp;and&nbsp;was&nbsp;in Singapore&nbsp;between 15 and 17 June 2022 and again on&nbsp;19 June as he flew in and out of Singapore. He&nbsp;tested positive for monkeypox on&nbsp;20 June. He is currently warded in at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and his condition is stable.&nbsp;Contact tracing&nbsp;is ongoing</span>.</span></span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">2.<span style=\"font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case had onset of headache on 14 June, and fever on 16 June. These symptoms subsequently resolved, and he then developed skin rashes on 19 June. He sought medical attention via teleconsultation on the night of 19 June, and was conveyed to NCID on 20 June for further assessment.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">3.<span style=\"font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contact tracing is ongoing for the affected flights and for the duration of his stay in Singapore. During this period, he had largely remained in his hotel room, except to visit a massage establishment, and eat at three food establishments on 16 June. In general, the risk of transmission to visitors at these locations is low, as data has shown that monkeypox transmits through close physical or prolonged contact. All four locations visited by the case are undergoing cleaning and disinfection.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 36pt; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">4.<span style=\"font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As of 21 June, 13 close contacts have been identified. All close contacts will be placed on quarantine for 21 days since their last contact with the case. In addition, two low-risk contacts have been placed on phone surveillance.

If suspected of being infected, they will be immediately conveyed to the NCID for further evaluation and isolation to prevent further transmission.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><strong>Health Advisory</strong></span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">5.<span style=\"font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Monkeypox is a viral disease that is caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. Infected persons would typically experience fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, lethargy and skin rash. The disease is usually self-limiting, with most patients recovering within two to three weeks. In some cases, however, the virus can cause serious complications. Individuals who are at higher risk of severe illness include young children, pregnant women or immunocompromised individuals.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 0cm 36pt; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">6.<span style=\"font-stretch: normal;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Human-to-human transmission is generally uncommon, but can occur via exposure to respiratory droplets or direct physical contact with the blood, body fluid or lesion material from infected individual or contaminated materials. The incubation period ranges from five to 21 days.

The rise is largely driven by increased spread of newer Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.<br><br><strong>More Community Cases with BA.5 Subvariant Detected</strong><br><br>2. Although the BA.2 subvariant still accounts for the bulk of our COVID-19 infections, the proportion of BA.4 and BA.5 infections is rising. About 30% of the COVID-19 cases in the community in the past week were cases with BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, as compared to 17%, 8% and 3% for the previous three weeks respectively. BA.5 alone is estimated to contribute to 25% of all cases this week. The surge in BA.4 and BA.5 cases is likely to continue, driven by their higher transmissibility compared to BA.2.<br><br>3. Currently international and local evidence shows that the severity of BA.4 and BA.5 infections is similar to that of earlier Omicron strains. The current Safe Management Measures (SMMs), including the requirement to wear masks while indoors and Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs for some higher-risk activities, will remain.<br><br>4. The Ministry of Health (MOH) will continue genomic surveillance for circulating subvariants in Singapore, including requiring some infected individuals to take an additional government-funded polymerase chain reaction swab for genomic sequencing.<br><br><strong>Hospital Capacity Remains Tight&nbsp;</strong><br><br>5. While we have not seen a significant increase of severe COVID-19 cases in our hospitals, and the number of cases in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) remain low, our public hospitals remain busy caring for non-COVID patients, and many hospitals experience high bed occupancies.<br><br>6. To ensure that precious emergency department (ED) resources are available to patients who need urgent emergency care, we strongly advise the public to only seek medical treatment at a hospital\u2019s ED for serious or life-threatening emergencies. Patients with minor ailments are strongly urged to seek medical attention at General Practitioner clinics.<br><br><strong>Vaccination and Boosters are an Important Line of Defence</strong><br><br>7. Vaccinations are critical to protect us against severe illness when infected with COVID-19, especially given the uptick in cases. In this regard, we strongly recommend that seniors aged 70 years and above (and especially those aged 80 years and above) take their second booster shot. All other eligible persons should complete their primary vaccination series and get at least their first booster as soon as possible. MOH will soon be deploying mobile vaccination teams to help seniors get boosted.<br><br>8. From 23 June 2022, five new Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) will begin vaccination and COVID-19 testing operations. Located in Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Sengkang, Woodlands and Yishun, the five new JTVCs will bring the total to 10 JTVCs across the island. These centres will offer the Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty and Moderna/ Spikevax vaccines. JTVC Bishan will offer the Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty and Novavax/ Nuvaxovid vaccines. Individuals aged 12 years and above may walk in to any of the JTVCs to receive their vaccination and booster.<br><br>9.

As we step up more JTVCs and consolidate our resources and free up this space for other uses, we will be closing the Vaccination Centre (VC) at Raffles City Convention Centre on 18 July 2022. The VC will accept appointments made via the National Appointment System and walk-ins for vaccination until 18 July 2022.<br><br><strong>Keeping our Guard Up</strong><br><br>11. While our population is now more resilient against COVID-19, everyone must continue to play their part to continue to observe the SMMs, exercise individual and social responsibility, such as by self-testing especially when symptomatic, and avoiding social interactions if one has fever or respiratory symptoms, or tests positive for COVID-19. As persons with early COVID-19 symptoms may test negative on the Antigen Rapid Test (ART), they should consider repeating an ART test the next day if symptoms continue or worsen. This is because it takes time for a person\u2019s viral load to reach the threshold for detection by the test kit.", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "rise-in-ba.4-and-ba.5-subvariant-cases-drives-recent-increase-in-covid-19-cases", "CurrentPageUrl": null, "CustomPressWidgetLocationUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
