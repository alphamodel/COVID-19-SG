To ensure that the quality and competencies of foreign-trained dental graduates who are eligible to register and practise in Singapore remain high, the standards of the mandatory Qualifying Examination (QE) will be benchmarked to the final-year dental professional examination taken by graduates of the National University of Singapore\u2019s Faculty of Dentistry.<br><br></span><strong style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Qualifying Examination<br><br></strong><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Presently, foreign-trained dental graduates with dentistry degrees listed in the Schedule of the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Dental Registration Act (DRA)&nbsp;</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">can apply for conditional registration to practise in Singapore as long as they fulfill the requirement of securing employment with a local dental clinic or healthcare institution, subject to other requirements under the DRA. Foreign-trained dental graduates</span><span style=\"text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;with basic dental qualifications not listed in the Schedule are similarly required to secure employment with a local dental clinic or healthcare institution. In addition, for this latter group, the SDC also mandates that they pass an examination to demonstrate the requisite knowledge and skills necessary for conditional registration as a dentist.<br><br>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;\">From 2029, foreign-trained dentists are required to demonstrate that they have the requisite clinical knowledge and procedural skills to practise dentistry in Singapore by taking and passing a QE, before they are eligible for conditional registration. Passing the QE will grant eligibility for conditional registration, the usual route by which most foreign-trained dental graduates are first registered in Singapore. The Dental Registration (Amendment) Bill passed in Parliament today will give effect to this requirement, irrespective of the graduate\u2019s nationality.<br><br></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;\">5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The new QE requirement will be effective from&nbsp;1 January 2029. This means that students who are currently enrolled in, or have secured places in dentistry degree programmes and would graduate before 1 January 2029, as well as foreign-trained dental graduates who already hold dental qualifications will not be affected by this change. They will be considered for conditional registration if they fulfil the requirements under the current DRA and until the measures takes effect from 1 January 2029.</span></p><p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\"></span><strong style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">Revision of Registrable Overseas Basic Dental Qualifications</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">The list of dentistry degrees in the Schedule to the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">DRA</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;will be revised</span><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;\">.
