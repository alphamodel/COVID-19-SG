Media Statement On Paediatric Mis-c Cases In Singapore



MEDIA STATEMENT ON PAEDIATRIC MIS-C CASES IN SINGAPORE


Published Date: 06 Nov 2021

The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been notified of four cases of
paediatric Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome-COVID (MIS-C) to date.
These four cases were amongst the over 8,000 paediatric COVID-19 cases
in Singapore since the start of the pandemic, and considered rare. Of
these four cases, one is in the Children’s Intensive Care Unit (CICU),
one is in a General Ward, and two have been discharged.
2. The four cases are:
a. A three-year-old boy admitted to the National University Hospital
(NUH) CICU on 16 October 2021. He had repeatedly tested PCR-negative,
but his serology test results indicated that he likely had a COVID-19
infection two to six weeks prior to the development of MIS-C. He has
since recovered and was discharged on 23 October.
b. An eight-year-old boy admitted to KK Women’s and Children’s
Hospital’s (KKH) CICU on 27 October 2021. He had been previously
diagnosed with COVID-19 infection on 30 September. He has since
recovered and was discharged on 1 November.
c. A four-year-old boy admitted to KKH CICU on 1 November 2021. As of 6
November, the boy remains in the CICU and his breathing is supported by
mechanical ventilation. He had previously tested positive for COVID-19
infection on 24 September. The KKH paediatric teams are actively
managing his care.
d. A two-month-old female infant admitted to KKH General Ward on 3
November 2021. She was previously admitted to KKH for COVID-19 infection
on 12 October, and discharged on 19 October. The patient’s condition
remains stable, with no oxygen requirements.
3. In May 2020, an international review from 26 countries reported a
MIS-C incidence of 0.14% (14 in 10,000) among all children with COVID-19
infection.
4. MIS-C is similar in presentation to Kawasaki Disease (KD) which has
been linked to various virus or bacterial infections, and occurs in 150
to 200 children a year in Singapore. Symptoms of MIS-C include
persistent fever above 38.5°C for three days or more, with difficulty
breathing, headache, neck swelling, rash, swollen hands and feet,
conjunctivitis, diarrhoea, or abdominal pain.
5. As MIS-C is linked to previous COVID-19 infection, measures such as
mask wearing, hand hygiene, and safe distancing measures remain
important to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.
