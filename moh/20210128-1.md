He subsequently worked from home from 11 January to 21 January. He developed nausea on 25 January, and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic on 26 January. As he also reported intermittent cough and a sore throat, he was tested for COVID-19 and his test came back positive on 27 January. He has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain. His serological test result has come back positive, which indicates a likely past infection.&nbsp;<br><br>Given their recent travel history, we have classified both cases as imported.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their household members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the&nbsp;<a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annexesd4215af0df1045f0b027f49f7bb0d3da.pdf?sfvrsn=129ea45d_0" title="Annexes ">Annexes </a> and MOH’s daily Situation Report (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases<br></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;44 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
