Another 3 cases (Cases 55754, 55807 and 55808) are Dependant\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from India on 31 July and the Philippines on 4 August. Another case (Case 55794), who is a Work Pass holder currently employed in Singapore, arrived from the Philippines on 4 August. The remaining case (Case 55810) is a Student\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from Russia on 4 August.<br></p><p>All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.

They had been placed on quarantine earlier, and were tested during quarantine to determine their status. Case 55790 is a technician who had boarded the affected vessel (reported in yesterday\u2019s press release) on 9 August to carry out essential repair and maintenance work. He was subsequently placed on quarantine when some crew members were confirmed to have COVID-19, and swabbed even though he is asymptomatic.<br></p><p>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br></p><p><br><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 78</strong><br></p><p>The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in the dormitories. There are currently about 19,900 workers who are still serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when their quarantine ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.<br></p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1597672797216000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEG7g4w4xd6LKb4MGJVSu-8NQ4z1g\" title=\"\" class=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/<wbr>situation-report</a>).
