    <p>Published Date: 09 Mar 2022</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The Ministry of Health (MOH) will further invest in enablers such as IT and innovation, as well as in infrastructure, which form critical supporting pillars of our healthcare system. This will support our healthcare transformation efforts and future-proof the healthcare system.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Investing in Infrastructure to Future-proof our Healthcare System<br><br></strong><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><em>Polyclinic development plans<br><br></em></strong><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">2.&nbsp; </span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">We had previously announced that we will expand our network of polyclinics to 32 [1]</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. A summary of our plans is as follows, of which those underlined are new announcements this year:<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">New Polyclinics<br><br></strong><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">a)&nbsp;</span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"> &nbsp;</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Sembawang Polyclinic, which is being developed as part of the Bukit Canberra integrated development, will open in 2022;<br><br>b)&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Six polyclinics planned in Kaki Bukit, Khatib, Serangoon, Tampines North, Tengah and Yew Tee are scheduled to be completed by 2026; and<br><br>c)&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Three more polyclinics planned in Bidadari, Bishan and&nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Taman Jurong</u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">&nbsp;are scheduled to be completed by 2030.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Polyclinic Redevelopments<br></strong><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; text-align: left;"><br>a)&nbsp; &nbsp;Pasir Ris, Clementi and&nbsp;</span><u style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; text-align: left;">Queenstown Polyclinics</u><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; text-align: left;">&nbsp;will be redeveloped by 2026, 2027 and 2030 respectively; and<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">b)&nbsp; &nbsp;Bukit Merah Polyclinic and Outram Polyclinic will be consolidated into a larger polyclinic in Tiong Bahru by 2030.<br><br></span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><em>New polyclinic in Taman Jurong and redevelopment of Queenstown Polyclinic<br><br></em></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">3.&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><em> &nbsp;</em></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">To meet the healthcare needs of our population, MOH will continue to invest in our primary care infrastructure. We will open a new polyclinic in Taman Jurong by 2028. Together with Pioneer and Jurong Polyclinics, the polyclinic in Taman Jurong will serve residents in the Jurong planning region.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">4.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">We will also redevelop Queenstown Polyclinic at a new site by the end of the decade. The existing Queenstown Polyclinic will serve residents living in the vicinity until the redeveloped Queenstown Polyclinic is operational.<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">The polyclinic in Taman Jurong and the redeveloped Queenstown Polyclinic will incorporate elderly-friendly and accessibility features for the convenience of the patients, and incorporate new requirements to ensure that the infrastructure is pandemic-ready. Both polyclinics will provide a comprehensive range of primary care services such as medical treatment for acute conditions, chronic disease management, women’s and children’s health services, allied health services, as well as radiological, laboratory and pharmacy services. We will share more details when ready.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Technology and Data as an Enabler for Better Health<br><br></strong><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><em>Leveraging technology to deliver better care<br><br></em></strong><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">6.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth technology solutions were deployed to meet the heightened demand for healthcare services. Accelerated by the pandemic, we will continue to leverage tele-treatment and tele-monitoring technologies to enhance convenience of care and improve overall health outcomes:<br><br>a)&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">COVID-19 Virtual Ward;<br>b)&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Mobile Inpatient Care at Home (MIC@Home) sandbox; and<br>c)&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Primary Tech-Enhanced Care (PTEC) Home Blood Pressure (BP) Monitoring<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">.</span></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><em style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">COVID-19 Virtual Ward<br><br></em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">7.&nbsp;</span><em style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"> &nbsp;</em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Daily reminders are sent via a chatbot or phone call for COVID-19 patients to measure and submit their vital sign readings, such as their body temperature and blood pressure. This has helped more than 700 patients on home recovery, and saved more than 5,000 physical bed days.<br><br></span><em style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">MIC@Home sandbox<br><br></em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">8.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">With the results achieved from the Virtual Ward programme, MOH will extend the programme to other groups of non-COVID-19 hospital patients under MIC@Home, which is suitable for patients who are typically stable, but still require hospitalisation to manage their active medical issues until they are fit for discharge. The MIC@Home mobile care teams will deliver selected inpatient-level services at home, including teleconsultation, remote vital signs monitoring, regular visits by doctors, nurses and therapists, intravenous therapy and simple blood investigations.<br><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">About 2,000 suitable patients will be enrolled into the programme over two years, starting in the first half of 2022. MOH will then study the implementation of the sandbox programme before considering scaling it up to a mainstream medical service model to complement inpatient hospital care for suitable patients.<br><br><strong></strong></span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><em>PTEC Home BP</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Monitoring<br><strong><br></strong></em><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">10.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Patients with chronic diseases visit polyclinics regularly to better manage their conditions. The </span>PTEC Home BP<span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;Monitoring programme was developed to provide remote care support with easy-to-use technologies for those with chronic high blood pressure so as to </span>help <span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">patients better self-manage their conditions with reduced visits to polyclinics.<br><br>11.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Patients enrolled in the programme</span>&nbsp;will receive Bluetooth-enabled home BP devices to monitor their blood pressure regularly</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. These readings are automatically transmitted via a mobile application to the polyclinic care team, who will then follow up with teleconsultations.<br><br>12.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">The PTEC Home BP Monitoring programme was officially rolled out at Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic in August 2020, following a one-year pilot. The programme was also introduced at Bedok Polyclinic in October 2020 and is being implemented at Clementi Polyclinic this year. The roll-out across the polyclinics island-wide is expected to be completed by 2023. The programme will also progressively include other chronic diseases such as diabetes.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><em>Use of Artificial Intelligence for early detection of dementia<br><br></em></strong><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">1</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">3.</span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Currently, one in 10 local seniors aged 60 years and above has dementia. Usually, a large proportion of our seniors and their caregivers are caught unaware until the seniors have reached a more advanced stage of the disease, missing the opportunity for early intervention. This is partly due to early symptoms being subtle, and requiring specialised tests, which can only be administered by a trained healthcare professional in a hospital of clinic.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;"><br>14.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Project Pensieve is a technology-driven initiative that supports earlier detection of dementia among seniors who are at high risk of the disease. Tapping on local clinical and technology expertise, an inter-agency team is developing a digital drawing test to estimate the risk of dementia automatically using artificial intelligence in just about 10 minutes.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">9 MARCH 2022</strong></p> <div><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><br clear="all"> </span><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"> <div id="ftn1"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px;">[1]&nbsp; Currently, there are 23 polyclinics, and our target of 32 polyclinics will be achieved after consolidating Bukit Merah Polyclinic and Outram Polyclinic into a larger new polyclinic in Tiong Bahru by 2030.</span></p> </div> </div></body>
