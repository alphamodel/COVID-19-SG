268 MORE CASES DISCHARGED, 248 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 16 Jul 2020

    As of 16 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed
and verified an additional 248 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore.
The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 4 (3 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 1 Work Pass
holder)
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 3 (Cases 47084, 47087 and 47091) are
Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned from the USA on 3 July
and Azerbaijan on 4 July. The remaining case (Case 47058) is a Work Pass
holder who is currently employed in Singapore. She arrived in Singapore
from Indonesia on 4 July. All of them had been placed on 14-day
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested
while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 11 (2 Singaporeans, 5 Work Pass holders, 2
Work Permit holders, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders)
Of the 11 cases in the community, 8 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 2 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. 10 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected
through our proactive testing.
5 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters.
They are all asymptomatic and were detected from proactive screening. Of
these, 2 cases (Cases 47173 and 47174) had been identified as contacts
of previously confirmed cases, and had been tested during their
quarantine to determine their status. Another 2 cases (Cases 47086 and
47088) were swabbed as part of our periodic screening of workers in the
construction sector. The remaining case (Case 47181) was identified as
we test individuals working in frontline COVID-19 operations.
6 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 5 cases
(Cases 47085, 47090, 47092, 47093 and 47170) are asymptomatic, and had
been detected as a result of our screening of workers in essential
services who are living outside the dormitories. Epidemiological
investigations are ongoing for the remaining case (Case 47204), who was
swabbed under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals
aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at
first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to detect infected
individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.
Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to
determine if these cases could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 16 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 12 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 8 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 7 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 233
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex

3.   Of the new cases, 96% are linked to known clusters, while the rest
are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.   In the past week (9 July to 15 July), MOH has uncovered links for
11 previously unlinked cases.
5.   Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.   268 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 43,256 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.   There are currently 146 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 3,697 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still
test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due
to COVID-19 infection.
