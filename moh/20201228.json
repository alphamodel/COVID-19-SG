Case 58766 is a Singaporean who works as a cabin crew with Singapore Airlines, and a part-time private hire car driver with Grab. He is asymptomatic, and was detected through proactive testing arranged by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore of air crew who had returned from overseas flights.</p><p>He recently travelled to the US for work from 12 December to 16 December on a controlled itinerary. He was tested on 23 December, but his test result came back inconclusive on 25 December, necessitating another test. A second test conducted on 25 December was also inconclusive. He had remained at home while awaiting further tests.</p><p>His swab on 27 December came back positive for COVID-19 infection and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on the same day. His serological test result is negative, which indicates a likely current infection. The cabin crew on the same US flight as Case 58766 have all tested negative for COVID-19 infection on 23 December.</p><p>Given the relatively long time interval between his travel and positive COVID-19 test, we have classified this case as locally transmitted while epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.</p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong></p><p>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Imported cases: 4</strong></p><p>Amongst the 4 imported cases, 3 (Cases 58768, 58769 and 58771) are Singaporeans who returned from India, Myanmar and the UK. The remaining case (Case 58767) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from India.
