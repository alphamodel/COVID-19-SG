Extension of the Suspension of In-person Visits At Residential Care
Homes



EXTENSION OF THE SUSPENSION OF IN-PERSON VISITS AT RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES


Published Date: 05 Oct 2021

   The Ministry of Health (MOH) had earlier announced on 12 September
2021 that in-person visits at all residential care homes (“Homes”) will
be suspended from 13 September to 11 October 2021 (both dates
inclusive), given the increasing number of COVID-19 cases amongst staff
and residents of Homes. In light of the emergence of several new
clusters at Homes in the past two weeks and the continued rise of
COVID-19 cases within the community, we will be extending the suspension
of in-person visits to all Homes to 24 October 2021 (inclusive). This is
in line with the Stabilisation Phase and will reduce the risk of
transmission of COVID-19 from the community to the Homes. The extension
will also provide more time for our seniors in the Homes to get
vaccinated or receive their booster shots.



2.  We urge the next-of-kin of unvaccinated seniors in the Homes
to support and encourage their loved ones to get vaccinated.
Unvaccinated seniors are more likely to suffer severe illness if
infected. It is also important for vaccinated seniors to receive their
booster dose immediately when they become eligible, to ensure a
continued high level of immunity and protection from severe disease.



3.  To ensure that seniors remain connected with their loved
ones, the Homes will continue to offer caregivers/next-of-kin the option
of telephone or video calls as an alternative to physical visits.



4.  We will observe the situation in the coming weeks and will
review the suspension of visitation accordingly. We seek the
understanding and cooperation of all Singaporeans as we continue to
implement measures to protect our seniors.
