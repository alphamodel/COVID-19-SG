Public Invited to Play A Part In Strengthening Youth Mental Well-being



PUBLIC INVITED TO PLAY A PART IN STRENGTHENING YOUTH MENTAL WELL-BEING


Published Date: 29 Sep 2021

1.   The Youth Mental Well-Being Network has moved to its
Call-to-Action phase, and welcomes contributions from members of the
public who would like to participate in projects that can make a
difference towards supporting youth mental well-being. Those interested
can look forward to taking up roles such as workshop facilitators for
mental well-being programmes, mentors for at-risk students, and content
creators for online mental well-being support platforms.



2.  The Network was set up in February 2020 to bring together
people from all walks of life to develop ground-up solutions to improve
youth mental well-being. It is supported by the Ministries of Social and
Family Development, Health, and Education, in collaboration with the
Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and the National Youth
Council.



3.  Since its formation, 1,500 individuals comprising youths,
parents, caregivers, mental health and social sector professionals have
joined the Network and developed 22 ground-up projects, which range from
efforts to enhance youthsâ€™ emotional resilience, to exploring ways to
strengthen peer support within the family, workplace, and community.



4.  In this Call-to-Action phase, interested individuals or
organisations can join a project to support its cause in improving youth
mental well-being. More details on the projects and volunteer
registration can be found at www.reach.gov.sg/youth-mental-well-being.



5.  Teams in the Network will continue to develop their projects
to see their ideas to fruition. The projects will complement the
existing platforms to strengthen the overall ecosystem of support for
youths.
