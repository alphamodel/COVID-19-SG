PIONEER GENERATION AND MERDEKA GENERATION SENIORS TO RECEIVE $255 MILLION IN MEDISAVE TOP-UPS IN JULY 2020


Published Date: 17 Jun 2020

         Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation seniors will receive
their 2020 MediSave top-ups in July. Together, they will receive a total
of $255 million in MediSave top-ups under the Pioneer Generation and
Merdeka Generation Packages. No action is needed as the amounts will be
credited directly into recipients’ MediSave accounts.
2.       These MediSave top-ups can be used to pay the premiums for
MediShield Life and other MediSave-approved insurance plans, as well as
medical expenses such as hospitalisation, day surgeries, and outpatient
treatments.
3.       By end-June, Pioneers and Merdeka Generation seniors will
receive letters informing them of the details of their MediSave top-ups
for 2020, which will be credited in July. The letters will also inform
them of other benefits that they are eligible for under the Pioneer or
Merdeka Generation Packages.
4.    About 450,000 Pioneers and 500,000 Merdeka Generation Seniors have
been receiving the MediSave top-ups as part of the Pioneer Generation
and Merdeka Generation Packages, since they were launched in 2014 and
2019 respectively.
5.       The Pioneer Generation and Merdeka Generation MediSave top-ups
are given on top of the annual MediSave top-ups for Singaporeans aged 65
and above in 2020, under the GST Voucher Scheme [1]. These top-ups will
be made in August 2020.
ELIGIBLE PIONEERS WILL RECEIVE A MEDISAVE TOP-UP OF UP TO $800
6.       This is the seventh year that Pioneers are receiving their
MediSave top-ups, since the introduction of the Pioneer Generation
Package in 2014.
7.        Pioneers will receive between $200 to $800 in Pioneer
Generation MediSave top-ups each year (see Table 1). The top-ups for
Pioneers will amount to about $160 million in 2020. More information on
all the benefits of the Pioneer Generation Package are at Annex A.
