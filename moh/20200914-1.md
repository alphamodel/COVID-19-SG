Another 2 (Cases 57548 and 57554) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India on 2 September. Another case (Case 57551), a Short-Term Visit Pass holder whose parent is a Singaporean, arrived from India on 5 September. The remaining case (Case 57552), who is also a Short-Term Visit Pass holder, is a technician who arrived from the US on 1 September on a work project.&nbsp;<br><br>All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 0</strong>&nbsp;<br><br>There are no cases in the community today.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 43</strong><br><br>Amongst the 43 cases residing in dormitories, 29 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 14 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past infections.&nbsp; The serological test results for 31 cases have come back positive so far, which indicate likely past infection.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
