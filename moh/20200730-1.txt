Published Date: 30 Jul 2020

          As of 30 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 278 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 4 (3 Work Pass holders, 1 Work Permit holder)
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 3 (Cases 51725, 51829 and 51830) are Work
Pass holders who are currently employed in Singapore, and had arrived
from India between 15 July and 18 July. The remaining case (Case 51889)
is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Indonesia on 18 July. All of
them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in
Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had
been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 4 (1 Singaporean, 3 Work Permit holders)
All 4 cases in the community today are linked to the cluster at Bukit
Panjang Integrated Transport Hub. They are asymptomatic, and were
detected as part of our proactive case finding of individuals working at
a newly emergent workplace cluster. To determine if these cases are
current or past infections, we also conducted serological tests for
them, and the results for all 4 cases have come back positive, which
indicate likely past infections . As a precautionary measure, MOH is
working with the Land Transport Authority to arrange for close contacts
of these cases to be tested. Epidemiological investigations are
ongoing.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 270
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.    Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 46,308 have fully
