Based on our investigations so far, there are 23 cases in the community, of whom 3 are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents and 20 are Work Pass holders. From our preliminary investigations, of these 23 cases, 5 were close contacts of earlier cases, and had already been placed on quarantine. Another 7 are migrant workers who reside together at a temporary accommodation arranged by their company. These cases were identified from our periodic screening of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories, and some may be past infections. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the other cases.</span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"><br>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, there are 3 imported cases, all of whom had been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.<br><br>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.&nbsp;</span></span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><br><br><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>6 JULY 2020</span></span></p>", "PressCategory": ["Highlights", "Press Releases"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "183-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
