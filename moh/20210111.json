They were tested during quarantine and confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 10 January.</p><p>Case 59170 is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Bangladesh on 14 December 2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 28 December. His swab done on 24 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19, and another swab taken as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) on 6 January was also negative. However another test on 8 January came back positive for COVID-19 infection. His polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test yielded a very high Ct value, which is indicative of a low viral load. His serological test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate a likely past infection, we have classified this case as imported. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.</p></p><p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annexes-(11-jan).pdf?sfvrsn=235a0aea_0\" title=\"Annexes \">Annexes </a>and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.</p></p><p><p><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong></p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 32 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
