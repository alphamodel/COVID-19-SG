Although the family members were seated at separate tables of up to five persons per table, investigations revealed that there had been mingling among them. The restaurant did not take reasonable steps to prevent the intermingling between tables on its premises.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Investigations against the restaurant, as well as Case 58401 and his family members are ongoing, and further enforcement action may be taken pending the outcome of investigations.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; MOH will not hesitate to take enforcement action against operators and individuals who fail to comply with the safe distancing and safe management measures. Any person convicted of an offence under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 is liable to a fine of up to $10,000, or up to six months\u2019 imprisonment, or to both. In the case of second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We urge everyone to continue to exercise social responsibility, and to comply with the prevailing measures. A resurgence of COVID-19 cases and clusters can easily emerge in our community if we let our guard down and become lax in adherence to SMMs.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>5 DECEMBER 2020</strong><br><br>==<br><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">[1]&nbsp;Case 58401 is a 32 year-old male Singaporean who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 25 November.
