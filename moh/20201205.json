Case 58461 is a Filipino sea crew who arrived from the Philippines on the Normand Australis, which docked at Tuas Port on 18 November. He had earlier been identified as a close contact of Case 58357 <sup>1</sup>, and was already placed on quarantine at a government quarantine facility since 22 November. Prior to that, he had not disembarked from the ship.<br><br>Before boarding the ship, Case 58461 had undergone a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 2 November which came back negative. Upon the ship\u2019s arrival in Singapore, all 18 crew members had been swabbed on 19 November, and all of them tested negative except for Case 58357. As a precautionary measure, the crew members were placed on quarantine, and Case 58461 was moved to a government quarantine facility to serve his quarantine. He is asymptomatic, and was swabbed during quarantine to verify his status. His serological test has come back positive.<br><br><strong>b)&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c)&nbsp; Imported cases: 12<br></strong><br>Amongst the 12 imported cases, 2 (Cases 58459 and 58465) are Singaporeans who returned from the US and Indonesia, and 4 (Cases 58460, 58462, 58469 and 58470) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from the US, India and Indonesia. Another 4 (Cases 58464, 58467, 58471 and 58472) are Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines. The remaining cases are a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder (Case 58466) who arrived from Nepal and a Short-Term Visit Pass holder (Case 58463) who arrived from Indonesia to visit her relatives who are Singaporeans.&nbsp;<br><br>Case 58465 is a Singaporean who had travelled to Indonesia under the Business Travel Pass.

He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 4 December, and is currently isolated at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Prior to hospitalisation, he had gone to work at ASL Shipyard Pte Ltd (19 Pandan Road), but had not interacted with his colleagues. His serological test has come back negative, which indicates likely current infection.
