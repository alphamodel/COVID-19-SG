UPDATE ON VACCINATION PROGRESS

1.     As of 20 August 2021, we have administered a total of 8,553,434
doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme
(Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty and Moderna), covering 4,467,533 individuals,
with 4,218,703 individuals having completed the full vaccination
regimen.

2.     In addition, 156,114 doses of other vaccines recognised in the
World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been
administered as of 20 August 2021, covering 84,345 individuals. In
total, 78% of our population has completed their full regimen/ received
two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 82% has received at least one dose.

CONDITION OF HOSPITALISED CASES

3.     364 cases are currently warded in hospital. There are currently
22 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 7 in
critical condition in the ICU. Of those who have fallen very ill, 23 are

4.     There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 8.8%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 1.7%.
