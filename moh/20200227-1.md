1\.     Four more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospital today (Cases 18, 72, 78 and 80). In all, 66 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.

2.     As of 27 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified three more cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. Of these, two are linked to previous cases. Contact tracing
is underway for the other case to establish any links to previous cases
or travel history to mainland China, or Daegu or Cheongdo in the
Republic of Korea.\

**Links between previous cases found**\

3.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was
made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.

    a)     Six of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33,
38, 83, 90 and 91), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life
Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). These six cases
are linked to another 23 confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57,
58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84, 88) who
are linked to the Grace Assembly of God.

    b) Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34
and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).

    c) Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to
the business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22
January.

    d) Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are
linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.

4\.     Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the
clusters, our investigations have identified the following links between
cases:\

-   Case 44 is linked to Cases 13 and 26;
-   Case 72 is linked to Cases 59 and 79;
-   Case 50 is linked to Cases 55, 65 and 77;
-   Case 75 is linked to Case 41;
-   Case 86 is linked to Case 82;
-   Case 95 is linked to Case 93; and
-   Case 96 is linked to Case 94.\

5.     Contact tracing is underway for the other 10 locally transmitted
cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to
mainland China, Daegu or Cheongdo.\

**Health advisory\
\
**20.     Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province
and all non-essential travel to Mainland China, and Daegu and Cheongdo
in the Republic of Korea. MOH also reminds the public to continue to
exercise caution when travelling to the rest of the Republic of Korea.

21\.     All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks
upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they
feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.

22\.     Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following
precautions at all times:\

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
    respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

23.     MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical
practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely
to see more cases that will need to be investigated.\
