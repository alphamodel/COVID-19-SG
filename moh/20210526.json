In recent weeks, the global situation has worsened, and we have observed the emergence of new and potentially more infectious variants. To manage the risk of imported cases and onward transmission within our community, we will be updating our pre-departure testing requirements.&nbsp;<br><br>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since November 2020, we have required all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore to present a valid negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken within 72 hours before their departure for Singapore. We had not made this a requirement for Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs) at that time, as we did not want to make it difficult for them to return home quickly, should they be caught unprepared by the rapidly deteriorating pandemic conditions abroad. Upon arrival, SCs and PRs would go through an on-arrival PCR test before we put them up at a dedicated Stay-Home Notice (SHN) facility. <br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have put in place advisories on overseas travel for some time now, and SCs and PRs abroad would have had more time to manage the risks of COVID-19 in the countries that they are in. Therefore from <strong>29 May 2021, 2359 hours, we will extend the pre-departure testing requirement to all Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. <u>All</u> travellers entering or transiting through Singapore (<u>including SCs and PRs</u>)</strong>, except for those who have stayed in lower-risk countries/regions [1]&nbsp;throughout the last 21 days before departure for Singapore, will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore. Only then will they be allowed to board their flight or ferry to Singapore [2]. All travellers will also be required to present their valid COVID-19 PCR test result at the air, sea and land checkpoints when they arrive in Singapore. <br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Travellers who arrive in Singapore without a valid negative test result may be denied entry into Singapore. PRs and long-term pass holders who fail to comply with the new requirement may have their permit or pass cancelled. <br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Travellers who test positive on their COVID-19 PCR test should seek appropriate medical care and ensure that they have fully recovered and are non-infectious before travelling to Singapore. Singaporeans who test positive for COVID-19 while overseas and require urgent medical care in Singapore can still return to Singapore via a medevac flight or other equivalent forms of conveyance. <br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the <a href=\"https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/\">SafeTravel website</a>. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry.<br></p> <div style=\"text-align: left;\"> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>26 MAY 2021</strong></p> </div> <div><br clear=\"all\"> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" style=\"text-align: left;\"> <div id=\"ftn1\" style=\"text-align: left;\"> <p>[1] This currently applies to travellers from Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Mainland China, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Macao.
