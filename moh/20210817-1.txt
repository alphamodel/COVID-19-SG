3. 404 cases are currently warded in hospital. There are currently 30
cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 6 in
critical condition in the ICU. Of those who have fallen very ill, 31 are
seniors above 60 years, of whom 25 are completely unvaccinated or
partially vaccinated.
4. Case 67329, a 90 year-old male Singaporean, has passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection on 17 August 2021. He had
developed symptoms on 29 July, and was detected when he was tested for
COVID-19 on 1 August as part of our community surveillance testing. The
following day, he developed shortness of breath and giddiness, and was
conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was admitted directly to the
ICU for septic shock from COVID-19 pneumonia. He had been fully
vaccinated against COVID-19, but was advanced in age and had a history
of chronic kidney disease and hypertension.
5. In total, 45 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19
infection.

6. There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 9.6%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 1.4%.
