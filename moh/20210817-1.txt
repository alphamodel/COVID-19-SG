GOVERNMENT ENHANCES SUBSIDIES TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY OF CANCER TREATMENT


Published Date: 17 Aug 2021

   The Government has accepted the MediShield Life Council’s
recommendations to (a) create a list of clinically proven and
cost-effective outpatient cancer drug treatments, (b) allow these cancer
drug treatments to be claimable under MediShield Life, and (c) set more
granular claim limits to provide better coverage based on the cost of
each treatment. The list will cover 90% of existing treatments in the
public sector, including some commonly used treatments that do not meet
the clinical and cost effectiveness criteria but are grandfathered onto
the list.

2.     These recommendations are in line with the approaches in other
developed countries such as the UK, Australia and South Korea. They will
support the procurement of cancer drugs at better prices and help to
keep MediShield Life premiums sustainable. MediSave withdrawal limits
and Integrated Shield Plan (IP) coverage will also be aligned to this
framework.
3.     At the same time, the Government will subsidise more cancer drug
treatments and extend Medication Assistance Fund (MAF) subsidies to more
Singaporeans by raising the eligible income criteria.
4.     The combined effect of these changes is that cancer patients will
pay less for clinically proven and cost-effective cancer drug
treatments. Close to 90% of subsidised Singaporean patients who use
these treatments will have their cancer drug bills fully covered by
subsidy and MediShield Life, subject to co-payment which can be paid
using MediSave. In comparison, under today’s system, 70% of all
subsidised Singaporean patients on cancer drug treatments have their
bills fully covered.
5.     There is a small proportion of patients who may find that their
current treatment will either no longer be claimable or have the claim
limit lowered with no subsidy extended. These changes will therefore be
implemented only in September 2022, to allow sufficient time
for existing patients to complete their current course of treatment and
adjust their treatment plans, where needed, to another treatment that is
efficacious, cost-effective and eligible for MediShield Life claims and
subsidies. The adjustments to IP coverage will be implemented in April
2023, giving insurers more time to implement the changes required.
MEDISHIELD LIFE COUNCIL’S RECOMMENDATIONS
6.     The MediShield Life Council appointed a Cancer Drug Committee,
comprising senior oncologists from the public and private sectors, to
review MediShield Life’s coverage of cancer drug treatments to support
Singaporeans’ continued access to good and affordable care, amidst
rising cancer prevalence and the emergence of higher cost cancer drug
therapies. The Government has accepted the recommendations of the
Council, which are also in line with the approaches in other developed
countries with advanced healthcare systems such as UK, Australia and
South Korea.
7.     Currently, patients can claim up to $3,000 per month under
MediShield Life for all outpatient cancer drug treatments and related
services. This has the unintended effect of raising cancer drug prices
to maximise the claims. The Council has therefore recommended that
MediShield Life should cover a positive list of clinically proven and
cost-effective cancer drug treatments, with more granular claim limits
ranging from $200 to $9,600 per month to be better aligned to the
different costs of cancer drug treatments. This will support procurement
of cancer drugs at better prices, and enable better targeted coverage
including higher claims limits where the treatment is clinically
appropriate and cost effective. A separate claim limit for outpatient
cancer drug services has also been recommended to cover other costs that
patients incur, such as scans, blood tests and doctor consultations.
8.     About 90% of the existing cancer drug treatments used in the
public sector will be included in the positive list. This may include
treatments that are common today but are not registered with the Health
Sciences Authority or are not cost-effective. They will be assigned a
claim limit similar to their subsidised alternatives, including generics
and biosimilars, where available. Patients are strongly encouraged to
discuss with their doctors on the use of available clinically proven and
cost-effective treatments for their conditions.
9.     The Council’s full report can be found in Annex A. The positive
list of cancer drug treatments that are claimable under MediShield
Life can be found at here, and will be updated every four months to keep
up with medical advancements.[1]
10.     Dr Tan Yew Oo, Chairman of the Cancer Drug Committee and Member
of the MediShield Life Councilsaid, “Recent developments in malignant
haematology and medical oncology such as the discovery of targetable
genes and development of immune checkpoint inhibitors have resulted in a
significant increase in the cost of cancer drug treatments. Many
patients are prescribed these novel therapies alone or in combination
with chemotherapy drugs for some cancer types. In some instances, there
is currently insufficient clinical evidence that these drugs are
effective in improving overall survival or duration of response. At the
same time, we are paying higher prices for many of the cancer drug
treatments in Singapore, compared to regional jurisdictions such as
South Korea and Australia. The current MediShield Life claim limit of
$3,000 per month is quite blunt and does not incentivise drug
manufacturers to offer better prices or encourage the use of clinically
proven and cost-effective treatments. The Committee has therefore
recommended changes to improve the design of the MediShield Life
scheme.”
11.     Mrs Fang Ai Lian, Chairman of the MediShield Life Council said,
“The Council has been looking at how MediShield Life can better support
the Government’s healthcare transformation efforts to ensure quality and
sustainable healthcare. This will also help to keep MediShield Life
premiums affordable for all Singaporeans. Focusing MediShield Life
coverage on clinically proven and cost-effective cancer drug treatments
will enable Singapore to negotiate for better drug prices and improve
affordability for more patients.The Council recognises the concerns
raised by patients during the focus group discussions that the positive
list may limit treatment options. To provide greater assurance to
patients who are already going through a challenging period, the Council
has recommended that existing cancer drug treatments that are commonly
used in the public sector be considered for inclusion in the positive
list, even if they are not cost-effective.”
SUBSIDY ENHANCEMENTS FOR ALL MAF DRUGS
12.     Subsidised patients in the public healthcare institutions
currently receive up to 75% subsidy for drugs under the Standard Drug
List (SDL) and MAF[2]. Following price negotiations with drug
manufacturers to achieve better drug prices and cost-effectiveness, 55
more cancer drugs will be listed under the SDL/MAF, which will increase
support for around 150 cancer drug treatments. The new MediShield Life
claim limits for cancer drug treatments will be set based on
post-subsidy bills.
13.     MAF subsidies will be enhanced with subsidies of up to 50%
extended to Singaporeans with per capita household income (PCHI) between
$2,800 and $6,500 per month (See Table 1), who do not enjoy subsidies
today. This subsidy enhancement will improve affordability for eligible
patients, and will apply to both cancer and non-cancer drugs listed on
MAF.

ADJUSTMENTS TO MEDISAVE WITHDRAWAL LIMITS
14.     The MediSave withdrawal limits for outpatient chemotherapy and
outpatient cancer scans will be adjusted in tandem with the MediShield
Life changes (see summary in Table 2 below).

15.     Please refer to Annex B for detailed illustrations on how bills
will be affected by the lower cancer drug prices and the changes in
subsidy, MediShield Life, and MediSave coverage.
INTEGRATED SHIELD PLAN (IP) COVERAGE
16.     Currently, most IPs provide as-charged coverage for outpatient
cancer drug treatments, subject to an overall policy year limit. To
ensure that IPs are aligned in encouraging the use of clinically proven
and cost-effective cancer drug treatments, IPs will be required to only
cover treatments that are on the MediShield Life positive list and set
claim limits for each cancer drug treatment.
17.     These changes do not affect IP riders, which are paid for fully
in cash. These changes will apply to all IPs sold or renewed from April
2023 onwards. Together with the changes to MediShield Life and MediSave,
these moves will help contribute to the affordability of cancer drug
treatments and sustainability of premiums in the long run.
18.     The Government thanks the MediShield Life Council, as well as
the Cancer Drug Committee, for the comprehensive review.

[1] The positive list will be based on recommendations by the MOH Drug
Advisory Committee (DAC), supported by the Agency for Care
Effectiveness, Singapore’s national Health Technology Assessment agency.
[2] Generally, less expensive drugs are listed on the SDL, while more
expensive drugs are listed on the MAF where they apply only when
prescribed to patients who meet clinical criteria specific to the drug
to ensure that their use is cost-effective.
