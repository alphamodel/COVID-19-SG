7.     There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 9.2%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 1.5%.

14.      MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst

extended for another 5 days until 30 August 2021 (inclusive).
15.      Staff who have been working in affected shops at Bugis Junction
are being tested, and close contacts of confirmed cases will be
quarantined. To uncover any community infection cases, we announced
yesterday that we are extending free COVID-19 testing to members of the
public who had visited the retail shops or used the services/ facilities
at Bugis Junction between 17 August and 24 August.
