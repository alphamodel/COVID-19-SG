Gradual Re-opening of Travel and Changes to Border Measures



GRADUAL RE-OPENING OF TRAVEL AND CHANGES TO BORDER MEASURES


Published Date: 15 Jun 2020

                The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has announced the plans for
a progressive re-opening of our economy and society. The Taskforce has
also been reviewing the border measures that we had put in place to
manage the risks of importation, and will likewise be implementing
progressive changes as we re-open to international travel. These include
ongoing discussions with various countries/regions on developing
bilateral arrangements for safe travel, and allowing more Long Term Pass
holders still outside Singapore to return.
2.              We have been monitoring the global situation closely to
determine the risk of importation from abroad. Countries/regions are at
various stages of putting in place effective systems to control the
infection. We will therefore update our border measures, taking into
account our understanding of the virus, as well as the developments in
these countries/regions.
TESTING OF ALL INCOMING TRAVELLERS
3.             Since 21 March 2020, all incoming travellers, including
Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holders[1],
have been required to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).Besides the
SHN, we will now put in place a testing regime for all incoming
travellers before the end of their SHN.The testing regime will apply to
all travellers entering Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours. It is
an additional precautionary measure to detect the virus, especially
given the risks of asymptomatic cases. We will monitor the results of
these tests and may make adjustments to the testing requirements over
time.
4.             The test will be scheduled a few days before the end of
the SHN period, at a designated community testing facility. Each person
under SHN will receive information on the scheduled appointment slot and
venue via an SMS notification. They will have to travel from their place
of residence to the designated testing facility, and return immediately
after the test, using their own private vehicle or designated transport.
Public transport should be avoided.
TRAVELLERS FROM SOME COUNTRIES/REGIONS TO SERVE STAY-HOME NOTICE AT
SUITABLE PLACE OF RESIDENCE
5.             With the testing regime in place, we will also update
the existing requirement for all incoming travellers to stay at
dedicated SHN facilities. For a start, all travellers entering Singapore
from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, and who had remained in Australia, Brunei
Darussalam, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand,
Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam in the last consecutive 14 days
prior to their entry, will no longer have to serve their SHN at
dedicated SHN facilities:
  a.  Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents may serve their 14-day
SHN at their place of residence.

  b.  Long Term Pass holders may serve their 14-day SHN at a place of
residence that they or their family members own or are sole tenants of;
or in suitable accommodation such as a hotel, at their own cost.
6.             All persons under SHN must remain in their place of
residence at all times. They will be subject to close monitoring of
their whereabouts, through electronic monitoring as well as physical
spot-checks. Strict enforcement action will be taken against those who
breach the requirements of the SHN.
7.             All other travellers entering Singapore will continue to
serve their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, for now.
8.             Notwithstanding the above changes, all Long Term Pass
holders will continue to require prior approval before entering
Singapore[2]. As the global and local health situations improve, we have
gradually increased the number of entry approvals given to Long Term
Pass holders, especially those with deep roots to Singapore or have
exigent circumstances. We expect to be able to facilitate the re-entry
of more Long Term Pass holders in the coming weeks. We will also study
how to facilitate business travels, in particular for professionals
based in Singapore who need to travel frequently as part of their work,
with the necessary safeguards.
9.             For now, we are not yet allowing short-term visitors,
except those coming in under the Green / Fast Lane arrangements
(starting with China, and eventually covering more countries/regions),
or with special prior approval.
TRAVELLERS TO BEAR COSTS OF COVID-19 TESTS AND STAY AT DEDICATED SHN
FACILITIES
10.             The Government has thus far borne the costs of stay at
dedicated SHN facilities for travellers entering Singapore, except for
those who left Singapore from 27 March 2020 despite the prevailing
travel advisory. The Government has also borne the costs of the large
majority of COVID-19 tests.
11.             Going forward, as we re-open our borders to more
international travel, those who enter Singapore would have to bear the
costs of fulfilling these requirements, as part of the cost of travel in
a COVID-19 world.
12.             In this regard, all inbound and outbound travellers who
enter Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, and leave Singapore from
17 June 2020, 2359 hours, respectively, will be required to pay for
their COVID-19 tests, where applicable. In addition, incoming travellers
who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, who enter
Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, will be required to pay for
their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, where applicable.
13.             Singapore’s measures for inbound travellers in relation
to COVID-19, including the new ones announced in this press statement,
are summarised in Annex A.
14.             The prevailing charges for the COVID-19 test and stay
at the dedicated SHN facilities are set out in Annex B.
15.             As Singapore’s border measures will evolve as the
global situation changes, we encourage everyone to check the MOH website
(https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19) for the latest updates.
UPDATED TRAVEL ADVISORY
16.             All Singaporeans and residents of Singapore are still
advised to defer all travel abroad. However, essential business and
official travel will be permitted under Green/ Fast Lane
arrangements[3].
