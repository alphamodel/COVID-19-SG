full regimen/ received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national

we have administered a total of 7,576,612 doses of COVID-19 vaccines
under the national vaccination programme, covering 4,307,602
individuals, with 3,391,799 individuals having completed the full

CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     590 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 35 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 8 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU). 4 amongst these 43 cases are fully
vaccinated. Of these, 3 require oxygen supplementation while 1 requires
ICU care as they have underlying medical conditions. 29 seniors above 60
years, of whom 26 are completely unvaccinated or partially vaccinated,
have fallen very ill.

6.    There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 55 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 33 are unvaccinated, 18 are partially vaccinated and 4 are fully
vaccinated.

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES
7.     Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased
from 1,056 cases in the week before to 862 cases in the past week. We
are likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as
we step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the
community. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased
from 119 cases in the week before to 282 cases in the past week. The
7-day moving average number of all linked community cases and all
unlinked community cases are 82.9 and 40.3 respectively.
