There are currently about 29,000 individuals who are due for their third dose, after having received two doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac. They are strongly recommended to receive a PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccine for their third dose unless medically ineligible to do so.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in 0in 0in 0.5in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This will help maintain the protection from the vaccine, as antibody levels from the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine declines rapidly within three to six months after completion of the second dose. Emerging international data indicates that while the mRNA vaccines, especially with booster vaccination, are protective against the Omicron variant, the Sinovac-CoronaVac and Sinopharm vaccines result in weaker neutralising activity and may not be protective.</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Taking the remaining dose of the three-dose primary regime will maintain the individual\u2019s fully vaccinated status.
