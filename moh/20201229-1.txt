Pilot for Extension of Subsidy and Medisave for Acupuncture At Public
Specialist Outpatient Clinics



PILOT FOR EXTENSION OF SUBSIDY AND MEDISAVE FOR ACUPUNCTURE AT PUBLIC SPECIALIST OUTPATIENT CLINICS


Published Date: 29 Dec 2020

      From 29 December 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will extend
means-tested subsidy and MediSave coverage under a pilot arrangement to
support acupuncture for lower back pain and neck pain at specialist
outpatient clinics (SOCs) in public healthcare institutions. Under the
pilot, about 2,000 patients per year, or more than 70% of the patients
who receive acupuncture for these indications at public SOCs, will be
eligible for subsidies.
2.    Under this pilot, subsidised patients referred by a medical
specialist in public hospitals for lower back pain or neck pain
acupuncture treatment will receive means-tested subsidies of up to 70%,
similar to other subsidised SOC services. For eligible patients,
additional Pioneer Generation (PG) and Merdeka Generation (MG) subsidies
of 50% and 25% off the remaining bill respectively will also apply.
3.    Regardless of their subsidy status, patients will also be able to
tap on the Flexi-MediSave scheme to pay for lower back pain and neck
pain acupuncture treatment at public SOCs.  The scheme allows patients
aged 60 and above to withdraw up to $200 per year from their own, or
their spouseâ€™s MediSave Account to pay for outpatient treatments.
4.   The pilot will not cover acupuncture used to treat other pain
indications, and other forms of traditional, complementary and
alternative medicine currently offered at public healthcare
institutions. MOH will review the expansion of the pilot to other
settings in the longer term, taking into account learnings and data from
this pilot.
