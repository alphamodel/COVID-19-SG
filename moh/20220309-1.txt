Keeping Healthcare Affordable and Improving the Well-being of Healthcare
Workers



KEEPING HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE AND IMPROVING THE WELL-BEING OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS


Published Date: 09 Mar 2022

   The Ministry of Health (MOH) will continue our ongoing efforts to
provide affordable healthcare. Beyond healthcare costs, we have been
taking active steps to safeguard the well-being of our workforce – the
backbone of our healthcare system to ensure the delivery of overall
better care.

ONGOING EFFORTS TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE

_EXPANSION OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS UNDER THE CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT
PROGRAMME
_2.   From 1 July 2022, three new conditions will be added to the
Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), bringing the total number
of approved chronic conditions under CDMP to 23. These are gout,
allergic rhinitis, and chronic hepatitis B.
3.   With these newly added conditions, CDMP will benefit about 134,000
existing polyclinic patients and Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS),
and Pioneer Generation (PG) and Merdeka Generation (MG) cardholders who
can tap on MediSave and/or CHAS subsidies to better manage these
conditions in the community.
4.   In addition, with this expansion, more than 60% of chronic
attendances at polyclinics would be covered under CDMP.
5.   MOH will continually review the list of conditions covered under
CDMP to better meet the needs of Singaporeans.
SAFEGUARD THE WELL-BEING OF OUR WORKFORCE
_SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT AND WELLNESS OF JUNIOR DOCTORS
_6.  _ _MOH has been working with the healthcare institutions and
relevant agencies to improve the well-being of healthcare workers,
including junior doctors. Various initiatives have been put in place at
the national and hospital levels, based on feedback from the young
doctors, their families and department heads, on issues such as working
hours, night calls and working conditions.
7.   At the national level, MOH has been working with the Singapore
Medical Council (SMC) to ensure adherence of working hours and call
requirements for Postgraduate Year 1 doctors. For residents, the
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has stipulated
restrictions on residents’ working hours and call requirements. These
restrictions on working hours also apply to the medical officers.
8.   Junior doctors’ wellness workgroups were also formed to address
specific issues related to junior doctors’ well-being and engender a
more conducive work environment that promotes mutual respect amongst
healthcare workers and their peers. Staff can also provide feedback on
disruptive workplace behaviour via confidential communication channels
so that timely interventions can be made.
9.   To further look into junior doctors’ wellness and provide
recommendations to improve their well-being at the systemic and national
level, the National Wellness Committee for Junior Doctors (NWC-JD) was
set up in December 2021. The NWC-JD will co-create solutions with
various stakeholders, including junior doctors, to improve the overall
well-being of our junior doctors.
10.   The Committee will focus on three key areas:

a)   Junior manpower and workflow models: The Committee will review
current workflow models, manpower and work hour norms and explore the
viability of different call systems, while ensuring that training
requirements are not compromised.

b)   Career development and training for junior doctors: To better
support junior doctors’ development, the Committee will reassess the
career and training opportunities available, so that the junior doctors
are better equipped to perform their roles and have more career options
in the public healthcare sector.
c)   Engagement, empowerment and mental wellness: The Committee will
look into ways to improve engagement with junior doctors, empower their
voices to be heard and better support junior doctors in their mental
wellness. They will work with key stakeholders to promote a more
inclusive culture where junior doctors can feel safe in speaking out on
their mental wellness.
11.   The Committee is chaired by Dr Daphne Khoo, Deputy Director of
Medical Services, Healthcare Performance Group, MOH. It comprises
representatives from MOH, MOH Holdings, SMC, and senior and junior
clinicians from all three healthcare clusters, including resident and
non-resident junior doctors. We will continuously monitor the well-being
of junior doctors and the effectiveness of the measures introduced.
_ESTABLISHING A TRIPARTITE WORKGROUP TO PREVENT ABUSE AND HARASSMENT OF
HEALTHCARE WORKERS
_
12._   _There has been a rise in the number of abuse and harassment
cases of our public healthcare workers over the past few years. This is
in spite of public healthcare workers coming under enhanced protection
under the Protection against Harassment Act (POHA). Furthermore, many
healthcare workers may hesitate to lodge official complaints and police
reports out of compassion and empathy that the aggressor is distressed.
COVID-19 has also drawn attention to protecting healthcare workers
beyond the public sector, highlighting a need to close the gap and
extend support to the private and community care workforce.
13.   We established a new Tripartite Workgroup for the Prevention of
Abuse and Harassment of Healthcare Workers in March 2022, which will
spearhead a coordinated national effort to prevent the abuse and
harassment of healthcare workers in the public, private and community
care sectors. The Workgroup includes representatives from MOH, the
Healthcare Services Employees’ Union, public healthcare clusters,
community care partners, and private healthcare providers.
14.   The Tripartite Workgroup will look into the following areas:

a)   Develop, coordinate and drive the implementation of strategies and
practices targeting the prevention of staff abuse and harassment in the
healthcare sector;
b)   Raise public awareness of what constitutes abuse and harassment of
healthcare workers and reach out to healthcare workers on the support
available to them; and
c)   Establish processes to ensure that these initiatives are being
implemented.
15.   This will enable a more holistic approach towards assuring all
healthcare workers that there are concerted efforts made to prevent and
address abuse and harassment directed at them.
