SINGAPORE’S CONTRIBUTION TO THE COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS (CEPI)


Published Date: 09 Mar 2022

             As part of our continued commitment to strengthen global
health security and provide support for fair and equitable access to
vaccines, Singapore will contribute USD15 million over five years to the
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).  This was
announced by Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Health, at the Global Pandemic
Preparedness Summit 2022.



2. COVID-19 has shone the spotlight on perennial
under-investment in pandemic preparedness. There is a clear need for
increased collective financing and action, such as in vaccine
development and production. The contribution from Singapore will go
towards CEPI’s mission of accelerating vaccine development against
emerging infectious diseases and enabling equitable access to these
vaccines.



3. Singapore has a strong interest and stake in pandemic
preparedness and we strongly urge all countries to work towards
collective global action for a strengthened global health system.
Singapore will continue to work closely with the global community to
overcome this pandemic together and prepare better for future ones.
