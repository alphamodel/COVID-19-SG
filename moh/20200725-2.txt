513 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 25 Jul 2020

              As of 25 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 513 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in
foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there
are 2 cases in the community, both of whom are Work Pass holders. In
addition, there are 6 imported cases who had been placed on Stay-Home
Notice upon arrival in Singapore.

2.          The Inter-agency Taskforce is on track to clear all the
dormitories by the beginning of August 2020, with the exception of 17
standalone blocks in 8 Purpose Built Dormitories, which serve as
quarantine facilities for 28,000 workers still serving out their
isolation period. This last batch of workers come from dormitories with
a relatively high prevalence of COVID-19, and will be subject to a final
test before they complete their isolation periods. We therefore expect
the daily case counts to be high for the coming two weeks, before
tapering down thereafter.

3.         We are still working through the details of the cases today,
and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will
be issued tonight.
