1 case per day in the week before, to none in the past week. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.

CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no new cases detected in dormitories for the first time since
25 March 2020.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 4
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 1 (Case 58042) is a Singapore Permanent
Resident who returned from India. Another case (Case 58040) is a
Short-Term Visit Pass holder who was allowed entry into Singapore to
visit a family member who is hospitalised here. The remaining 2 cases
are a Training Employment Pass holder (Case 58041) who arrived from
India, and a Student’s Pass holder (Case 58039) who arrived from France.
They had all been placed on 14-day SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
Case 58041 served SHN at a dedicated facility upon arrival in Singapore
on 25 September. He was tested on 5 October while serving SHN and his
test result was negative for COVID-19. He completed his SHN on 9 October
and developed onset of symptoms on the same day. He subsequently tested
positive for COVID-19 infection on 12 October when he took a
pre-departure test in order to return to India. Between 9 October and 12
October, he had mostly remained at Dream Lodge Singapore (172 Tyrwhitt
Road) but visited the National University Health System (NUHS) Tower
Block on 9 October.
4.    Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
5.        Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
6.         MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at
Mandai Lodge I (460 Mandai Road) for the past two incubation periods
(i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
7.      Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
8.     12 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,740 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
9.       There are currently 35 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 81 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
