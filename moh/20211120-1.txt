Resuming Our Transition Towards Covid Resilience



RESUMING OUR TRANSITION TOWARDS COVID RESILIENCE


Published Date: 20 Nov 2021

On 20 October 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced the extension
of the Stabilisation Phase for four weeks, through to 21 November 2021.
With the efforts and cooperation of everyone, our overall infection
numbers and hospital situation have largely stabilised and improved. In
the coming weeks, a significant proportion of the population would have
had or will be receiving their vaccination boosters. Overall, we are in
a better position to proceed with further easing of our community Safe
Management Measures (SMMs), in a careful and calibrated manner, and exit
the Stabilisation Phase into a Transition Phase.
2. From 22 November 2021, we will increase group sizes for dine-in and
social gatherings from 2 to 5 persons, irrespective of whether the group
members are from the same household or not. We will also extend our
Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) to protect the
unvaccinated from getting infected and becoming severely ill. In-person
visits to hospitals and residential care homes will also resume with VDS
in place. To enhance protection for our population as we ease community
measures, we will also accelerate our booster vaccination programme.
3. Even with these moves, it is important that we remain disciplined and
vigilant. While the local situation is stabilising and our healthcare
system is still able to manage the current caseload, we must not let our
guard down. We should not seek to push the limits, but should continue
to exercise restraint in our social interactions even as we approach the
year-end period. All of us need to continue to play our part to prevent
another wave of infection which could put pressure on our healthcare
system.
UPDATES ON LOCAL COVID-19 SITUATION AND HEALTHCARE CAPACITY
4. The week-on-week ratio of community cases has remained stable at
around 0.8 to 1.0 this past week. Daily case numbers have come down to
less than 3,000 a day on average. Out of the infected cases, close to
99% of cases continue to have mild or no symptoms and the vast majority
are recovering well at home.
5. The proportion of patients who require oxygen supplementation has
held steady at 0.8% of our total cases, and those who require intensive
care unit (ICU) care is at 0.2%, in the past 28 days. The number of
cases in the ICU remains high but stable in the past week at around 120
cases per day. Our overall ICU occupancy in the past week is at
approximately 60%. The unvaccinated continue to make up a
disproportionate number of ICU patients and those requiring
hospitalisation.
UPDATES TO SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURES FROM 22 NOVEMBER 2021
(A) Increase in Social Gathering Group Size
6. From 22 NOVEMBER 2021, we will INCREASE THE PERMISSIBLE SOCIAL
GATHERING GROUP SIZE FROM 2 PERSONS TO 5 PERSONS. The cap of 2 distinct
visitors per household per day will correspondingly increase to 5
distinct visitors per household per day. As far as possible, we should
accept only visitors who are vaccinated, so as to protect those who are
unvaccinated from exposure to the virus. Unvaccinated individuals should
also exercise caution and protect themselves by reducing their movement
and staying at home as much as possible. In addition, visitors to
households that have an unvaccinated person or vulnerable elderly are
strongly encouraged to test themselves prior to the visit to ensure that
they do not unwittingly transmit COVID-19 to those who are vulnerable.
(B) Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) for F&B
settings
7. GROUPS OF UP TO 5 PERSONS, EVEN IF NOT FROM THE SAME HOUSEHOLD, WILL
BE ALLOWED TO DINE-IN AT FOOD AND BEVERAGE (F&B) ESTABLISHMENTS IF ALL
THE DINERS ARE FULLY VACCINATED. Unvaccinated children aged 12 years and
below (i.e. born in 2009 or later) may be included within the group of 5
persons as long as all these children are from the same household. As
previously announced, medically ineligible persons may also be included
within such groups of 5 persons from 1 DECEMBER 2021. Nevertheless, we
continue to caution medically ineligible persons of their susceptibility
to severe illness if infected with COVID-19, and urge them to be careful
despite such a concession.
8. SUCH GROUPS OF UP TO 5 PERSONS WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED TO DINE-IN AT
HAWKER CENTRES AND COFFEE SHOPS WHERE FULL VDS CHECKS HAVE BEEN
IMPLEMENTED. THE INITIAL BATCH OF HAWKER CENTRES AND COFFEE SHOPS THAT
ARE READY WILL START SUCH CHECKS FROM 23 NOVEMBER 2021, AND MORE WILL DO
SO WHEN READY with access control and systems to perform vaccination
checks at entry points. Otherwise, dining-in at hawker centres and
coffee shops without full VDS checks will remain at groups of up to 2
fully vaccinated persons. Unvaccinated individuals are not allowed to
dine-in and may continue to only take-away food from these
establishments. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been actively
consulting the Hawkers’ Associations, and working with the Town Councils
and NEA-appointed operators, to also implement access control with
vaccination checks at entry points at the remaining hawker centres by
the end of November 2021. NEA and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) will
share more details on the first group of hawker centres and coffeeshops.
(C) Marriage Solemnisations and Wedding Receptions
9. We will be adjusting the SMMs for WEDDING SOLEMNISATIONS AND WEDDING
RECEPTIONS FROM 22 NOVEMBER 2021 so that couples may safely include more
activities in their wedding celebrations. This includes unmasking by the
wedding couple throughout the reception or solemnisation event, and
singing by members of the Wedding Party at the reception, subject to
additional precautions. To include such activities in their event, THE
WEDDING COUPLE OR SUCH INDIVIDUALS FROM THE WEDDING PARTY WILL BE
REQUIRED TO (I) UNDERGO AN ANTIGEN RAPID TEST (ART) MINIMALLY SUPERVISED
BY THE VENUE OPERATOR¹; OR (II) HAVE A VALID PET obtained within 24
hours prior to the event. More details will be provided in a separate
advisory by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).
(D) Expanding VDS to More Venues
10. Vaccination is key to protecting our population even as SMMs are
further relaxed. FROM 1 DECEMBER 2021, WE WILL EXPAND VDS TO MORE
SETTINGS AND ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING IN ALL LIBRARIES UNDER THE NATIONAL
LIBRARY BOARD (NLB), AND SELECTED ACTIVITIES IN COMMUNITY CLUBS/CENTRES
UNDER PEOPLE’S ASSOCIATION (PA). By restricting entry to only
individuals who have been fully vaccinated, we can further reduce the
risk of transmission in such settings.
11. A summary of the updated community measures from 22 November 2021
can be found in Annex A.
(E) Removal of VDS Concession for Voluntarily Unvaccinated Individuals
12. We will further strengthen efforts to protect unvaccinated
individuals from getting infected, as they are subject to greater risks
of severe illness. Under current rules, unvaccinated individuals can get
a PET and show a negative test result to enter a VDS setting. We will
remove this concession for unvaccinated individuals to perform PET in
lieu of being fully vaccinated.  Hence, ONLY FULLY VACCINATED,
RECOVERED, OR MEDICALLY INELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS, OR CHILDREN AGED 12
YEARS AND BELOW (SUBJECT TO VENUE/EVENT-SPECIFIC CAPS) WILL BE ALLOWED
TO ENTER SETTINGS WHERE VDS IS IMPLEMENTED. We will effect this on 1
JANUARY 2022, to allow time for more individuals to complete their
primary series vaccination regime.

FURTHER RESUMPTION OF SENIOR-CENTRIC ACTIVITIES
13. In line with our updated adjustments to SMMs and drawing lessons
from the resumption pilots launched to-date by the People’s Association
and SportSG, we are working on the resumption of more senior-centric
activities in a safe manner, enabled by the use of VDS for such
activities. In the coming weeks, seniors can look forward to more
active-ageing programmes such as exercise programmes offered by the
Health Promotion Board and participate in other forms of learning under
the National Silver Academy. Details will be released soon.
RESUMPTION OF IN-PERSON VISITS TO HOSPITALS AND RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES
WITH VDS IN PLACE
14. To continue protecting vulnerable individuals in our hospitals and
residential care homes (Homes) but conscious also of the well-being of
our patients and residents, WE WILL RESUME IN-PERSON VISITS TO HOSPITALS
AND HOMES WITH ENHANCED VDS-RELATED MEASURES IN PLACE, FROM 22 NOVEMBER
2021. The strict implementation of such VDS measures will minimise the
risk of outbreaks, which may otherwise jeopardise the lives of
vulnerable patients and residents and affect the operating capacity of
our hospitals and residential care homes.
15. SUCH IN-PERSON VISITS WILL BE ALLOWED ONLY WHEN BOTH THE HOSPITAL
PATIENT/ HOME RESIDENT AND THEIR VISITORS ARE FULLY VACCINATED. As a
concession, we will also allow visits for medically ineligible
patients/residents and visitors. If the patient/resident and/or visitor
are not fully vaccinated, in-person visits will only be allowed under
exceptional circumstances on a case-by-case basis, as advised by the
hospitals and Homes. More details for visits to hospitals and Homes can
be found in Annex B. For avoidance of doubt, this measure does not apply
to individuals seeking medical care from our hospitals.
TAPERING OF SUPPORT MEASURES
16. As we exit the Stabilisation Phase, the Government will
correspondingly taper down the support measures to the following:
a. 10% Jobs Support Scheme support from 22 November to 19 December 2021
for F&B, retail, cinemas, museums, art galleries, historical sites,
family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, and performing
arts and arts education. Please refer to Annex C for details.
b. 0.5 month rental waiver for the cooked food and market stallholders
in centres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators.
c. COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund payout at $10 and $5 per vehicle per day
in December 2021² and January 2022 respectively for taxi and private
hire car drivers.
17. The total sum of the support measures is $90m. This will be funded
from the higher-than-expected revenues collected to-date. There will be
no further draw on Past Reserves.
ENHANCING PROTECTION BY ACCELERATING OUR BOOSTER VACCINATION PROGRAMME
18. Booster vaccination significantly increases protection against
infection and severe disease, and prevents waning of vaccine protection.
Today, based on an earlier recommendation from the Expert Committee on
COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V), we are administering boosters six months
after the second dose for those aged 30 to 59, and five months after the
second dose for those aged 60 and above.  The EC19V has studied further
international and local data. It is evident that waning of antibodies
can clearly occur by around six months after the second dose and occur
earlier for older groups. It now recommends that we standardise the
interval rate to five months for all age groups eligible for boosters,
as this would be an appropriate interval to pre-empt waning of
antibodies for all.
19. Therefore, ELIGIBLE PERSONS WILL NOW BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THEIR
BOOSTER DOSES STARTING FROM FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THEIR
PRIMARY SERIES (TYPICALLY WITH TWO DOSES OF THE MRNA VACCINES), AND SMS
INVITATIONS WILL BE SENT TO THEM BEFORE THAT. This will provide
individuals more flexibility in planning and getting their booster
vaccination in a timely manner, before significant waning in protection
occurs. We encourage everyone eligible for the booster vaccination to
receive it when it is offered to them, so as to achieve high levels of
protection. For those who are eligible based on the criteria to-date
(aged 30 and above, frontline workers at higher risk of COVID-19
infection, etc.), but have not received their SMS invitations, they are
also invited to walk in to any Moderna Vaccination Centre to receive
their booster vaccination without a need to book an appointment.
TOWARDS A COVID-19 RESILIENT SINGAPORE
20. Even as we resume our transition towards living with COVID-19, we
need to do so in a careful and controlled manner. We seek everyone’s
cooperation to exercise social responsibility and cooperate with the
SMMs which have been put in place. If you are offered a vaccination or
booster dose, please also come forward and get vaccinated. These will
ensure the current situation continues to remain stable, and allow us to
progressively resume our social and economic activities.
