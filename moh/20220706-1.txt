Confirmed Local Case of Monkeypox In Singapore



CONFIRMED LOCAL CASE OF MONKEYPOX IN SINGAPORE


Published Date: 06 Jul 2022

          The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed one local case of
monkeypox infection in Singapore. The patient is a 45
year-old male Malaysian national who resides in Singapore. He tested
positive for monkeypox on 6 July 2022. He is currently warded at the
National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and his condition is
stable. He is not linked to the imported case announced by MOH on 21
June.



2.  The case first developed lower abdomen skin lesions on 30
June, and subsequently experienced fatigue and swollen lymph nodes on 2
July. On 4 July, he developed fever and a sore throat and sought medical
attention where initial tests for other possible medical conditions were
done. When these tests returned negative, he was subsequently conveyed
to NCID on 6 July, where he was isolated for further assessment.



3.  As of 6 July, three close contacts have been identified,
involving two housemates and one social contact. All close contacts will
be placed on quarantine for 21 days from their last contact with the
case. Contact tracing is ongoing.



4.  Monkeypox is typically a self-limiting illness where
patients recover within two to four weeks. A small percentage of those
infected can fall seriously ill or even die. Those particularly
vulnerable to complications are young children, pregnant women or
immunocompromised individuals. Given that transmission requires close
physical or prolonged contact, the risk to the general public remains
low.



5.  MOH will continue to monitor the monkeypox situation
closely and calibrate our preparedness and response measures as needed.
Members of the public are encouraged to exercise personal responsibility
by monitoring their personal health and maintaining good hygiene,
especially during travel. They should also avoid close contact with
other individuals known or suspected to be ill with monkeypox
infection.
