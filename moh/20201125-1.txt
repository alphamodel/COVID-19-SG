3. Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4. Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
5. As we gradually reopen our economy and resume social activities, the
government has been testing more extensively in the community to
facilitate early detection and to obtain a better picture of population
prevalence. So far we have conducted such surveillance testing for
taxi/private hire car drivers, food delivery personnel and cashiers. As
part of the progressive rollout of community surveillance testing, we
will extend testing for stallholders in and around Tekka Centre. The
testing operations will be conducted near Little India MRT station on 26
November 2020.
