    <body><h1> 29 More Cases Discharged, 12 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 23 Sep 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 23 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 12 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:</p><p><strong>Summary of new cases</strong><br><br>All new cases today are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance.<br></p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">Already in quarantine/ isolation before detection</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">Detected from surveillance</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">Total</p></td></tr><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p>Imported cases</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">4</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">0</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">4</p></td></tr><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p>Cases in the community</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">1</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">0</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">1</p></td></tr><tr><td width="241" valign="top"><p>Cases residing in dormitories</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">4</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">3</p></td><td width="120"><p align="center">7</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 4 (3 Permanent Residents, 1 Work Pass holder)<br></strong><br>Amongst the 4 imported cases, 3 (Cases 57776, 57782 and 57783) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India on 11 September. The remaining case (Case 57781) is a Work Pass holder currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Iran on 11 September.<br><br>All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 1 (1 Work Permit holder)</strong><br><br>Case 57775 had been identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. He was tested during quarantine to determine his status, even though he is asymptomatic.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 7</strong><p><br>Amongst the 7 cases residing in dormitories, 4 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The remaining 3 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.</p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
