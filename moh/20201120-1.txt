Updated Border Measures for Travellers From Malaysia and Japan



UPDATED BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM MALAYSIA AND JAPAN


Published Date: 20 Nov 2020

       The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the
global COVID-19 situation and will be tightening border measures given
the resurgence of cases in Malaysia and Japan. All travellers entering
Singapore from 22 NOVEMBER 2020, 2359 HOURS, who have a travel history
in the past 14 days to MALAYSIA will now be required to serve a 14-day
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities. All travellers
[except Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs)] entering
Singapore from 27 NOVEMBER 2020, 2359 HOURS, who have a travel history
in the past 14 days to MALAYSIA will be required to take a COVID-19
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure.
2.         All travellers entering Singapore from 22 NOVEMBER 2020, 2359
HOURS, who have a travel history in the past 14 days to JAPAN will be
required to serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, even if they
have obtained approval to opt out earlier.
TRAVELLERS FROM MALAYSIA TO SERVE 14-DAY SHN AT DEDICATED SHN FACILITIES
AND HAVE PRE-DEPARTURE TEST
3.      We had earlier announced that travellers from Malaysia
(excluding Sabah) are allowed to serve a 7-day SHN at their place of
residence while travellers with travel history to Sabah, Malaysia are
required to serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.
4.      Given the sharp increase in cases in Malaysia recently, all
travellers entering Singapore from 22 NOVEMBER 2020, 2359 HOURS who have
a travel history (including transit) in the past 14 days to Malaysia
will be required to serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. This
also applies to travellers entering Singapore to work under the Periodic
Commuting Arrangement and returning Singapore-based travellers under the
Singapore – Malaysia Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL).
5.          In addition, travellers who are not SCs or PRs, and who have
recent travel history to MALAYSIA within the last 14 days prior to entry
will be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before
departure. Travellers will need to present a valid negative COVID-19
test result as a condition of approval to enter Singapore. This
requirement will take effect for those arriving in Singapore from 27
NOVEMBER 2020, 2359 HOURS. This requirement will not apply for returning
Singapore-based travellers under the Singapore – Malaysia RGL.
TRAVELLERS FROM JAPAN TO SERVE 14-DAY SHN AT DEDICATED SHN FACILITIES
6.         As there has been a sharp increase in cases in Japan in the
past week, all travellers entering Singapore from 22 NOVEMBER 2020, 2359
HOURS who have a travel history to JAPAN in the past 14 days will be
required to serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. These
travellers will no longer be able to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities
and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, even if they
have obtained approval to opt out earlier. The 14-day SHN at dedicated
SHN facilities also applies to returning Singapore-based travellers
under the Singapore – Japan RGL.
7.       This is revised from our announcement on 27 October 2020 that
travellers from Japan were allowed to opt out of serving their 14-day
SHN at a dedicated SHN facility if they had a suitable place of
residence.
8.         Travellers from Fiji, Finland, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka,
Thailand and Turkey will continue to be allowed to apply to opt out of
dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of
residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:
a. Travelled to no other country/ region than above-mentioned countries
[1], in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and
b. Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address)
alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN
with the same travel history and duration of SHN.
The COVID-19 tests will continue to be administered before the end of
the SHN.
REGULAR REVIEW OF BORDER MEASURES
9.        As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust
our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission
to the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the
Safe Travel Office website (https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg). Travellers
are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border
measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to
the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their
stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and treatment.
10.     All travellers are reminded to accurately declare their travel
history. Strict enforcement actions will be taken against false
declarations.
