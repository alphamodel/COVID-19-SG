    <p>Published Date: 26 Sep 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 26 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 20 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>Summary of new cases</strong><br><br>All new cases today are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance.&nbsp;</span></span></p><div style="text-align: justify;"><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="220" valign="top" style="text-align: justify;"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><br></span></p> </td> <td width="117" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Already in quarantine/ isolation before detection </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="118" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Detected from surveillance </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="110" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Total</strong></span></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="220" valign="top" style="text-align: justify;"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Imported cases</strong></span></p> </td> <td width="117" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">5</span></p> </td> <td width="118" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">0</span></p> </td> <td width="110" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">5</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="220" valign="top" style="text-align: justify;"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Cases in the community </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="117" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">0</span></p> </td> <td width="118" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">1</span></p> </td> <td width="110" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">1</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="220" valign="top" style="text-align: justify;"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Cases residing in dormitories </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="117" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">7</span></p> </td> <td width="118" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">7</span></p> </td> <td width="110" style="text-align: justify;"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">14</span></p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 5</strong> (1 Work Pass holder, 3 Work Permit holders, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder)<br><br>Amongst the 5 imported cases, 4 (Cases 57823, 57824, 57830 and 57831) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India and Indonesia on 14 September, and Brazil and the Philippines on 13 September. The remaining case (Case 57829) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from India on 15 September.&nbsp;<br><br>All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 1</strong> (1 Work Permit holder)<br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 57822 was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories. He was asymptomatic, and was detected through our proactive testing. Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for his household contacts to determine if he could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 14</strong><br><br>Amongst the 14 cases residing in dormitories, 7 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 7 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

In all, 57,359 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are currently 25 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 274 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
