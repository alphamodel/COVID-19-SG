4.    Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.    Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
6.   We are investigating a Malaysian truck driver who works as a
freelance deliveryman and was denied entry into Singapore on 18 February
after testing positive for COVID-19 for an antigen rapid test (ART) at
Woodlands Checkpoint. His polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test came back
positive for COVID-19 infection on 19 February. His previous trip to
Singapore was on 8 February, when he tested negative for COVID-19 for
his ART at the Checkpoint. Our investigations found that he had visited
Resorts World Sentosa Casino on 9 February before departing for Malaysia
on the same day. While he is not included in the case count as he had
not been allowed entry into Singapore after his positive ART test, we
will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary
measure, including placing all identified close contacts on quarantine.
7.    Malaysian truck drivers are not allowed to mingle in the community
other than for delivery purposes and are not to stay overnight.
Investigations are ongoing to assess if there had been any breach of the
relevant prevailing measures.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
8.   12 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,731 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or

9.    There are currently 22 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 87 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
