He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 7 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and he was immediately isolated. An individual test was done on 9 February, and his test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day. He was subsequently conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 24 January – were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back positive but we are unable to rule out that this could be a recent infection. As a precautionary measure, all his close contacts at the dormitory and his workplace have been placed on quarantine.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 14<br></strong><br>Amongst the 14 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>• 1 (Case 60132) is a Singaporean and 2 (Cases 60118 and 60128) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India, Malaysia and the UK.<br>• 1 (Case 60113) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from the US.<br>• 2 (Cases 60119 and 60121) are Work Pass holders who arrived from Brazil and Russia.<br>• 6 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines, of whom 4 (Cases 60105, 60114, 60120, and 60135) are foreign domestic workers.<br>• 2 (Cases 60115 and 60116) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders.

In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases<br></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 20 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
