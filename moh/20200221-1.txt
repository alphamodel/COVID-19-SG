LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
3.            Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This
was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
a)   Four of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38
and 83), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and
Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road).
b)   Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 34
and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).
c)   Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to
the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22
January.
d)   Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are
linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.
e)   22 of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60,
61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81 and 84) are linked to

-   Case 72 is linked to Cases 59 and 79;
-   Case 50 is linked to 55, 65 and 77;
-   Case 75 is linked to Case 41; and
-   Case 86 is linked to Case 82.

5.            Contact tracing is underway for the other eight locally
transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel
history to mainland China.

confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving.
Five are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.
UPDATE ON CONTACT TRACING FOR CONFIRMED CASES
13.            Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once
identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a
precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their
last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts
who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.
14.            As of 21 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 2,696
close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 1,122 are currently
quarantined, and 1,574 have completed their quarantine.
HEALTH ADVISORY
15.            Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei
Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.
16.            All travellers should monitor their health closely for
two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly
if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their
travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g.
cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic
ahead of the visit.
17.            Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating,

    after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory
    secretions after coughing or sneezing);

-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

18.            MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is
likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
