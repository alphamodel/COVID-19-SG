3.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
4.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
5.     MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at
Tuas View Dormitory (70 Tuas South Avenue 1) for the past two incubation
periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
6.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.     2 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,821 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.     There are currently 43 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 41 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
