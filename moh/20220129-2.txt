CLOSE TO 1,000 GENERAL PRACTITIONER CLINICS OPEN DURING CHINESE NEW YEAR


Published Date: 29 Jan 2022

    988 general practitioner (GP) clinics, of which 523 are Public
Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), will be open at various times
during the Chinese New Year public holidays from 31 January to 2
February 2022. The public may access the latest list of GP clinics and
their operating hours through:

-   The Ministry of Health’s (MOH) corporate website;
-   The Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC) website;
-   Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) webpage;
-   HealthHub mobile application, which is available on both iTunes and
    the Google Play Store; and
-   phpc.gov.sg for the list of PHPCs.

2.  We encourage members of the public, including children, who feel
unwell during the festivities to visit their GP or a 24-hour clinic for
minor conditions. Those who develop symptoms of acute respiratory
infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose) as well as fever
and loss of taste or smell, are strongly encouraged to visit a PHPC.
3.  324 selected PHPCs will be able to provide COVID-19 swabs during the
Chinese New Year period. 11 Combined Test Centres (CTCs) across the
island will also continue to operate and take in patients who have been
referred for a swab by their doctor.
4.  Members of the public should first call the clinics to confirm the
availability and timing of services, particularly for COVID-19 testing
and vaccinations, and make appointments as needed before heading to the
clinics.To book your COVID-19 swab at the CTCs, please
visit www.go.gov.sg/ari-covid-19-testing.
5.  Individuals cared for by telemedicine providers, such as those on
the Home Recovery Programme, will continue to have access to these
services.
6.  We advise the public to seek medical treatment at a hospital’s
Accident & Emergency (A&E) department only for serious or
life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness, and
uncontrollable bleeding. To ensure that the 995 Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) is able to provide swift conveyance for those with
emergency conditions, we advise individuals who are not experiencing
life-threatening emergencies to refrain from calling 995.
7.  We seek everyone’s continued effort and cooperation to exercise
social responsibility and comply with all the safe management measures
that have been put in place. Test yourself regularly and follow the
adjusted health protocols at www.covid.gov.sg. By doing so, can we
strengthen our collective resilience against the evolving COVID-19
situation.
8.  MOH wishes everyone a happy Chinese New Year and a healthy year
ahead. We would also like to take this opportunity to remind the public
to eat in moderation and continue exercising regularly to stay healthy
over the holiday period.
