She arrived in Singapore on 20 January 2021 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 3 February. Her swab done on 2 February during SHN was negative for COVID-19. Her COVID-19 pre-departure test taken in Indonesia on 18 January was also negative.&nbsp;<br><br>She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she was tested on 9 March as part of MOH\u2019s investigation into Case 60666<sup>1</sup>. As an added precaution, MOH tested all attendees of the Settling in Programme for foreign domestic workers on 4 February, which both Cases 60666 and 60818 attended, even though they were not close contacts. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 9 March, and she was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Her serological test result has come back positive, which indicates a likely past infection. However as we are unable to definitively confirm her date of infection, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.<br><br>Based on our epidemiological investigations, Cases 60666 and 60818 are likely to have been separately infected earlier and there is currently no evidence that the 2 cases are linked.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 7</strong><br><br>Amongst the 7 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>\u2022 1 (Case 60807) is a Singaporean who returned from Qatar.<br>\u2022 1 (Case 60803) is a Student\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from India.<br>\u2022 1 (Case 60816) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from India.<br>\u2022 4 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and Malaysia.<br><br>They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annexes---11-mar-2021.pdf?sfvrsn=6a36ba6c_2\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 28 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
