A)  IMPORTED CASES: 14 (2 Singaporeans, 7 Permanent Residents,
1 Work Pass holder, 3 Work Permit holders, 1 Student’s Pass holder)

Amongst the 14 imported cases, 2 (Cases 57272 and 57277) are
Singaporeans, and 7 (Cases 57271, 57278, 57295, 57296, 57297, 57298 and
57299) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from
India between 24 August and 28 August, and Ghana on 28 August. Another 4
(Cases 57241, 57242, 57243 and 57290) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders
currently employed in Singapore who arrived from the Philippines on 28
August and India on 28 August. The remaining case (Case 57287) is a
Student’s Pass holder who arrived from Kazakhstan on 29 August.

All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.



B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Work Permit holder)

There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to a cluster. Case
57300 was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of
workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living
outside the dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.



C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 60

Amongst the 60 cases residing in dormitories, 29 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.

The remaining 31 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.

Of the cases residing in dormitories today, 31 are from Westlite Toh
Guan dormitory, the vast majority of whom had been placed on quarantine
earlier and were tested during quarantine to determine their status. The
remaining cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our
bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past
infections.[1] The serological test results for 22 cases have come back
positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.

2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.  Of the new cases, 92% are imported or linked to known
cases/ clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.



LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

4.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

5.  31 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 56,492 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

6.  There are currently 34 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 613 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.



MINISTRY OF HEALTH
9 SEPTEMBER 2020

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
