CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 4
There are 4 cases in the community today, of whom 2 are currently
unlinked and 2 are linked to previous cases.
Case 59340
Case 59340 is a 39 year-old male Singaporean who works at Singapore
Scouts Association (1 Bishan Street 12), handling mainly administrative
work in the office. He is also a part-time bus driver with Westpoint
Transit who plies specific routes for Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and
GlaxoSmithKline Tuas.
He developed a fever on 11 January, and sought medical treatment from a
general practitioner via tele-consultation, and again at a polyclinic on
13 January where he was tested for COVID-19 as part of our enhanced
community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are
diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at first presentation to a
doctor.
He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 15 January and was
conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases
(NCID). His serological test result has come back negative, indicating
that this is likely a current infection. He had not gone to work after
onset of symptoms.
Case 59351
Case 59351 is a 39 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case
59340. She developed acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms on 13
January and sought medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic
the next day. She was referred to a polyclinic to take a COVID-19 test
on the same day. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19
infection on 15 January and she was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID.
Her serological test result is pending.
She works as an administrative officer at OCBC Tampines Centre One (11
Tampines Central 1) but does not interact with customers. Her last day
at work was on 8 January, before onset of symptoms.
Case 59343
Case 59343 is a 33 year-old male Chinese national who is a Work Permit
holder. He works as a food processing worker at Golden Bridge Foods
Manufacturing Pte Ltd (30 Senoko South Road).
He developed a cough on 7 January and sought medical treatment at a
general practitioner clinic. He was swabbed but his test result came
back negative for COVID-19 on 8 January. He stayed at home on medical
leave between 7 January and 12 January, and went back to work on 13
January.
However he developed a fever on 14 January and sought medical treatment
at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital where he was again tested for COVID-19. This
time, his test result came back positive on 15 January and he was
conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. His serological test result has come
back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.
Case 59347
Case 59347 is a 28 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case
59280 . She had been identified as his close contact earlier and was
placed on quarantine on 13 January.
She developed ARI symptoms on 14 January and was tested for COVID-19.
She was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 15 January and was
conveyed to NCID in an ambulance. Her serological test result has come
back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.
She works as a Prison Staff Officer at Singapore Prison Service but does
not interact with Prison inmates. Due to workplace safe management
measures, she has mainly been working from home during this period.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory who is currently unlinked. Case
59350 is a 37 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Permit holder.
He resides at Tuas South Dormitory (1 Tuas South Street 12) and works at
Chevron Oronite Pte Ltd (21 Sakra Road) as a thermal insulator
installer.
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when his test taken on 14 January
as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) came back positive for
COVID-19 infection. His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 17
December – were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test
result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current
infection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family and
household members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on
quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine
period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct
serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could
have been infected by them.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 19
Amongst the 19 imported cases,
• 1 (Case 59339) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from
India.
• 3 (Cases 59329, 59331 and 59332) are Dependant’s Pass holders who
arrived from the UAE and India.
• 2 (Cases 59327 and 59330) are Student’s Pass holders who arrived from
India and France.
• 5 (Cases 59328, 59337, 59341, 59342 and 59348) are Work Pass holders
who arrived from India, Japan, Spain and the UAE.
• 6 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India and Myanmar, of whom
3 (Cases 59333, 59335 and 59336) are foreign domestic workers.
• 1 (Case 59346) is a sea crew holding a Special Pass who arrived from
Brunei onboard a vessel on 5 January and had not disembarked. He was
tested for COVID-19, and conveyed to the hospital when his result came
back positive.
• 1 (Case 59345) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
Myanmar for a job placement.
They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.
Cases 59348 and 59349 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India on
25 December 2020 and served SHN at dedicated facilities until 8 January
2021. Their swabs done on 5 January during SHN were negative for
COVID-19, and subsequent tests on 9 January and 11 January were also
negative. Their tests on 14 January came back positive for COVID-19
infection, although the Ct values were very high, which are indicative
of low viral loads. Their serological test results have also come back
positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have
classified these cases as imported. They are likely to be shedding
minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and
infective to others.

(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
4.       13 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,784 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
5.       There are currently 54 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 216 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
6.      The recent locally transmitted cases are a stark reminder that
we cannot afford to let our guard down. We must continue to keep up our
discipline in adhering to the safe management and safe distancing
measures, so as to avoid an uncontrolled resurgence of cases that may
necessitate a tightening of measures.
