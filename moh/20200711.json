The breakdown is as follows: </p><p><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imported cases: 1</strong> (1 Work Pass holder)</p><p>There is an imported case today involving an Indian national who returned to Singapore from India on 6 July. She is a Work Pass holder who is currently employed in Singapore. She had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving SHN.</p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases in the community: 24</strong> (7 Singaporeans, 6 Work Pass holders, 11 Work Permit holders)</p><p>Of the 24 cases in the community, 19 were picked up as a result of our proactive surveillance and screening, and 5 had already been placed on quarantine earlier. 20 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were all detected through our proactive testing. </p><p>15 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters. Of these, 5 (Cases 45702, 45771, 45779, 45781 and 45821) had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been tested during their quarantine to determine their status. The rest of the cases were detected through our proactive testing, even though they are all asymptomatic. 9 of them were swabbed as they work in essential services, and the remaining case (Case 45672) was tested as part of our efforts to screen individuals working in frontline COVID-19 operations.</p><p>9 of the community cases are currently unlinked. All of them are asymptomatic, and were identified from our periodic screening of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories. </p><p>Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to determine if these cases could have been infected by them. </p><p>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 19 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 9 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 145</strong></p><p>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1594565106037000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHLoBPdIRJqLuYrLc_kt7bGU8o_4A\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/<wbr>situation-report</a>).
