This tender approach was adopted to ensure that the selected concept proposal is aligned with our vision for a private assisted living development.</p><p><p>4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Under this approach, tenderers are required to submit their concept proposals and tender prices separately. The concept proposals will first be evaluated by a Concept Evaluation Committee (CEC), chaired by MOH, based on criteria such as suitability and innovativeness of the proposed model of care, as well as quality of the proposed care programmes and services.</p></p><p>5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Only concept proposals that are shortlisted will proceed to the second stage of evaluation, which will be based only on price. The site will then be awarded to the shortlisted tenderer with the highest bid price.</p><p>6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is not an announcement of tender award. A decision on the award of the tender will be announced at a later date after the tenders have been evaluated. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>URBAN REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY<br></strong><strong>21 MARCH 2023</strong></p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "tender-closing-for-private-assisted-living-development-site-at-parry-avenue", "CurrentPageUrl": null, "CustomPressWidgetLocationUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
