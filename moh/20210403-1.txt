stable at 2 cases per week in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked
cases in the community has also remained stable at 2 cases per week in
the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as
well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.

April, 55 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 85 have
tested negative, and 40 serology test results are pending.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 61508 is a 24 year-old female Myanmar national who is a foreign
domestic worker. She arrived from Myanmar on 30 January and served SHN
at a dedicated facility until 13 February. Her test taken on 12 February
during SHN was negative for COVID-19. Following her SHN, she moved into
a boarding house for foreign domestic workers while waiting for
deployment to an employer, and had not left the boarding house from 13
February to 9 March. On 9 March, she started work at her employer’s
residence.
She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she was swabbed on 1 April as
part of MOH’s investigation into Case 61184¹. As an added precaution,
MOH tested all close contacts of Case 61184, including those, like Case
61508, who had interacted with her outside of her infectious period.
Case 61508’s test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 2
April, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious
Diseases in an ambulance. Her serological test result has come back
positive. She could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a
past infection, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude
that she had been infected before her arrival in Singapore, we will take
all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine if the 2 cases
are linked but in the meantime, we have classified Case 61508 as a local
unlinked case. All the identified close contacts of the case, including
her household members, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and
will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that
we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests
for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected
by them.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 17
Amongst the 17 imported cases,
-  3 (Cases 61525, 61530 and 61534) are Singapore Permanent Residents
who returned from Brazil, India and Ivory Coast.
-  2 (Cases 61522 and 61529) are Student's Pass holders who arrived from
India and the UAE.
-  4 (Cases 61528, 61536, 61537 and 61538) are Work Pass holders who
arrived from India.
-  7 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India,
Indonesia and the Philippines, of whom 2 (Cases 61510 and 61531) are
foreign domestic workers.
-  1 (Case 61517) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
Myanmar to visit his family member who is a Singapore Permanent
Resident.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
4.     Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     9 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,185 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 41 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 212 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
