We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>Case Details</strong><br><br><strong>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases in the community: 1</strong><br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 58401 is a Singaporean who works as a Service Engineer at Master Systems Marine Pte Ltd. His job entails going onboard vessels docked at Marina South Pier and West Coast Pier for servicing and maintenance of ships' navigational systems. He typically worked alone, and had no interaction with vessel crew except for a supervising crew member. On days when he was not working onboard vessels, he had remained at his office located at Vertex Building Tower B (33 Ubi Avenue 3). He reported that he wore a surgical mask during his work onboard the vessels and at the office, and that safe distancing and safe management measures were adhered to.<br><br>The case developed a fever and sore throat on 23 November night, and sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner clinic the next day, where he was tested for COVID-19 under our enhanced community testing regime. He was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases the following day, when his test came back positive for COVID-19 infection. His serological test has come back negative, indicating that this is a fresh infection.<br><br>Epidemiological investigations are in progress. It was revealed that on 21 November, he had dinner with 12 family members at Seoul Garden at Tampines Mall. They had occupied 3 tables and there was mingling between the groups. Amongst those present at the dinner was his 2 year-old niece, who had earlier been issued a 5-day medical certificate (from 20 November to 24 November) for runny nose. Investigations are ongoing to assess if there had been any breach of the relevant safe management measures.&nbsp;<br><br>In the meantime, all his identified close contacts (including his family members at the dinner) have been isolated and placed on quarantine and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests on his household and family contacts to determine if he could have been infected by them.<br><br>We urge everyone to continue to exercise social responsibility, and to cooperate with the prevailing measures. This is yet another reminder that the virus has not been eradicated and that new cases and clusters can easily emerge in our community, if we let our guard down.<br><br><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.<br><br><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imported cases: 4</strong><br><br>Amongst the 4 imported cases, 2 (Cases 58402 and 58403) are Dependant's Pass holders who arrived from Pakistan. The remaining 2 cases are currently employed in Singapore. Case 58400 is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Malaysia and Case 58404 is a Work Pass holder who arrived from Nepal. They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annexes---26-nov-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=7106a25a_2\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\"></a><a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.

Travelled to no other country/region than above-mentioned countries [1], in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and&nbsp;<br><br>b. Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.&nbsp;<br><br>The COVID-19 tests will continue to be administered before the end of the SHN.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the <a href=\"https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">SafeTravel website</a>. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and treatment.<br><br><strong>COVID-19 testing for more identified community groups&nbsp;<br></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been progressively conducting testing operations for identified community groups, such as stallholders, food delivery personnel and cashiers across the island. These operations aim to provide a better picture of population prevalence and facilitate the early containment of cryptic cases in the community, especially as we continue to reopen our economy and allow more activities to resume.&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More than 5,000 individuals have been tested at Marine Parade, Ang Mo Kio and Taman Jurong since September 2020, and all who have participated in these voluntary testing exercises have tested negative for COVID-19. The results of the community testing operations indicate very low prevalence rates in the community, and is an indicator that our safe management measures are helping to keep our community safe.&nbsp;<br><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even whilst community prevalence is low, we must not let our guard down. Hence government agencies will be reaching out to other identified community groups to offer COVID-19 testing on a one-time basis. We are offering COVID-19 testing to stallholders in and around Tekka Centre this week. In the coming weeks, we will also be offering COVID-19 testing to individuals working at key delivery centres (e.g. Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre) and key logistics delivery companies.&nbsp;<br><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We strongly encourage individuals in these identified community groups to come forward and utilise the testing services offered. The costs of these tests will be fully borne by the government.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Enabling A Safe Reopening<br></strong><br>10.&nbsp; &nbsp; We will continue to review and calibrate our border measures to enable a safe reopening of our borders, while facilitating the resumption of key economic activities which are critical for livelihoods. Testing remains a key enabler to safe reopening, and we will continue to extend surveillance testing progressively to more community groups across Singapore.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>26 NOVEMBER 2020<br><br></strong>[1] Including the following countries/regions: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand, Taiwan and Vietnam (correct as of 26 November 2020).</p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "updates-on-border-measures-and-community-surveillance-testing-operations", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": "1 New Case of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1606320000000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "26 Nov 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 26 November 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 1 new case of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection.
