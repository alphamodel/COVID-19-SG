COVID-19 infection, of which 27 are linked to the Jurong Fishery Port

CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
4.     567 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 23 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 2 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU). 1 amongst these 25 cases is fully vaccinated,
but requires oxygen supplementation as she has underlying medical
conditions. 16 seniors above 60 years, of whom 15 are completely

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES
6.     Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased
from 765 cases in the week before to 915 cases in the past week. We are
likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as we
step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the community.
The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from 45
cases in the week before to 217 cases in the past week. The 7-day moving
average number of all linked community cases and all unlinked community
cases are 99.7 and 31 respectively.

_Closure of Home’s Favourite Pte Ltd_
9.     MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
individuals who worked in Home’s Favourite Pte Ltd (15 Jalan Tepong,
#04-08 and #04-09). To date, we have detected 6 cases linked to the
cluster, and our epidemiological investigations have found that there is
likely ongoing transmission at the premises. To break the chain of
transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, Home’s Favourite
Pte Ltd will be closed to all members of the public from 29 July to 12
August 2021. All staff will be placed on quarantine, and will be tested
during quarantine.
_Community surveillance testing for visitors to Taman Jurong Market &
Food Centre_
10.     MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
markets and food centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who
visited Jurong Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the
markets and food centres. To uncover any community infection cases, we
will extend free COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had
visited Taman Jurong Market & Food Centre (3 Yung Sheng Road) between 13
July and 27 July. Please refer to https://go.gov.sg/tj-testing for
details on the testing operations.
11.     All visitors to the affected premises are advised to monitor
their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as
possible, for 14 days from their date of visit or interaction. They are
encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.
PROGRESS OF NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAMME
12.     As of 27 July 2021, we have administered a total of 7,305,300
doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme. The
total number of doses administered was 7,305,300, covering 4,267,577
individuals. 3,158,737 individuals have completed the full vaccination
regimen, consisting of 121,014 recovered persons who received at least
one dose and 3,037,723 who received their second dose. In addition,
