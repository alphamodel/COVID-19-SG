2.     Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased
from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of
fewer than 1 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in
the community has also decreased from an average of fewer than 1 case
per day in the week before, to none in the past week. We will continue
to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through
our surveillance programme.
3.      All the new cases today are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today. He was detected through
our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories.
This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so
that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 2
Of the 2 imported cases, 1 (Case 58051) is a Singaporean who returned
from the US, and the other (Case 58052) is a Work Permit holder
currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Indonesia. Both cases
had been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while
serving SHN.
4.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
5.    Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
6.     MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at
SCM Tuas Lodge (80 Tuas South Boulevard) for the past two incubation
periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
7.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
8.     12 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,764 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
9.     There are currently 36 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 64 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
