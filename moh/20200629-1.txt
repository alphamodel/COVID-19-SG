477 MORE CASES DISCHARGED; 202 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 29 Jun 2020

       As of 29 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 202 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

A) IMPORTED CASES: 0
There are no imported cases today.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 6 (4 Singaporeans, 2 Work Permit holders)
Of the 6 cases in the community, 4 had been picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier.
Amongst the 4 Singaporean cases, 1 (Case 43538) had been identified as a
contact of a previously confirmed case, and had already been quarantined
earlier. He was swabbed during quarantine to verify his status. Another
2 (Cases 43539 and 43637) were detected due to our proactive
surveillance of persons working at dormitories or deployed to frontline
COVID-19 operations, even though they are asymptomatic. Epidemiological
investigations are ongoing for the remaining case (Case 43691).
Both Work Permit holders (Cases 43540 and 43638) are asymptomatic, and
had been swabbed as part of our proactive screening of workers in
essential services or those working at dormitories.
Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections.[1] The serological test results for Cases 43539 and
43540 have come back positive, which indicate likely past infections.
The test results for the remaining cases are pending.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 4 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
c) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 196
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     Of the new cases, 97% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
4.     We announced on 28 June that a student at East Spring Secondary
School had tested positive for COVID-19. As a precaution, 39 students
and 11 staff who had been in close contact with the student have been
put on Leave of Absence by the Ministry of Education or Home Quarantine
Order by MOH. They have been tested for COVID-19, and their test results
have all come back negative.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.     In the past week (22 June to 28 June), MOH has uncovered links
for 5 previously unlinked cases.
6.      Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.     477 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 37,985 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.      There are currently 197 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 5,453 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 26 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
