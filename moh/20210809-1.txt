CLARIFICATIONS IN RESPONSE TO QUERIES ON (1) ELIGIBILITY FOR DINING IN F&B OUTLETS; AND (2) RECOGNITION OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION’S EMERGENCY USE LISTING (WHO EUL) VACCINES


Published Date: 09 Aug 2021

(1) ELIGIBLE DINERS FOR DINING-IN IN F&B OUTLETS
1.     At the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) press conference on 6
August 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced that F&B
establishments are permitted to seat
fully vaccinated diners in groups of up to 5 persons. “Fully vaccinated”
means two weeks after receiving a full regimen of the
Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccines, or any of the vaccines on
the WHO EUL listing, with the vaccination status updated in MOH’s
national IT system as indicated in Section (2) below.
2.     In addition, the following individuals are eligible to dine-in at
F&B establishments if they:
a.  Have recovered from COVID-19 and have a valid Pre-Event Test (PET)
exemption notice¹; or
b. Have a negative PET result for the duration of his/her dine-in² from
an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider within the last 24 hours; or
c.  Are children aged 12 years and below, so long as all children at a
given table are from the same household.
3.     MOH and ESG would like to clarify that F&B ESTABLISHMENTS ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO ACCEPT ANY DINE-IN CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA IN
(A)-(C) ABOVE.  Enforcement officers will be doing their checks, and
will take strict enforcement actions against any F&B establishments and
individuals who do not comply with these rules.
4.     UNVACCINATED INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT MEET ANY OF CRITERIA (A)-(C)
CAN DINE IN GROUPS OF UP TO 2 PERSONS ONLY AT COFFEESHOPS AND HAWKER
CENTRES. For now, the concession for unvaccinated persons to dine
applies SPECIFICALLY TO HAWKER CENTRES AND COFFEESHOPS³. We encourage
unvaccinated individuals who dine at such locations to vigilantly
maintain hand hygiene, and not to linger after their meals, in order to
reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19.
(2) UPDATING AND VERIFICATION OF VACCINE STATUS
5.     All Singapore residents who obtained their
Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or  Moderna locally would automatically have
their vaccination records updated in the National Immunisation Registry
(NIR), and reflected on the TraceTogether and HealthHub Apps from 10 Aug
2021. This will also enable businesses using the SafeEntry (Business)
App to easily verify the vaccination status of their customers.
 Residents who received Sinovac locally will also be able to access
their vaccination record on the HealthHub App from 10 Aug 2021, pending
further updates to TraceTogether and the SafeEntry (Business) App.
6.     Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders
(LTPHs) who have been fully vaccinated overseas (be it
Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, Moderna, or any of the other vaccines under
the WHO Emergency Use Listing) will have to provide documents showing
proof of vaccination and take a serology test at an approved provider to
confirm that the vaccination has been effective.  Upon a positive
serology result, their vaccination record will be updated in the
National Immunisation Registry (NIR), and reflected on their
TraceTogether and HealthHub Apps.  More details on the process,
including the list of the approved providers, can be found on MOH’s Post
Vaccination Matters website.
7.     We will have a separate process for Short-Term Visitor Pass
holders who were vaccinated overseas to update their vaccination status
on the NIR. This is still being worked out, and details will be released
soon.
8.     Hard copies of overseas vaccination certificates will not be
accepted for the vaccination-differentiated safe management measures.
This is because it will be difficult for individual establishments to
verify the authenticity of these certificates which are issued in
different formats and languages.
9.     We look forward to the cooperation of all Singaporeans as we
strive towards a COVID-resilient Singapore.
