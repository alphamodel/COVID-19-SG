Published Date: 20 Jul 2020

1.      As of 20 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 123 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A)  IMPORTED CASES: 2 (1 Work Pass holder, 1 Work Permit holder)
Both imported cases, who are Work Pass holders currently employed in
Singapore, arrived in Singapore from the Philippines on 8 July. They had
been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore,
and had been tested while serving their SHN.
B)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 11 (5 Singaporeans, 1 Work Pass holder,
5 Work Permit holders)
Of the 11 cases in the community, 9 were picked up as a result of our
proactive surveillance and screening, and 2 had already been placed on
quarantine earlier. 9 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected
through our proactive testing.
6 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters.
Of these, 2 (Cases 48059 and 48102) had been identified as contacts of
previously confirmed cases, and had been placed on quarantine earlier.
They were tested during quarantine to determine their status. The
remaining 4 cases (Cases 48041, 48042, 48043 and 48044) are all
asymptomatic, and were identified as a result of our periodic screening
of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories.
5 of the community cases are currently unlinked. They are all
asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening. Of these,
2 cases (Cases 48046 and 48047) were swabbed as they work in essential
services. The remaining 3 cases (Cases 48056, 48057 and 48058) were
tested as part of our efforts to screen individuals working in frontline
COVID-19 operations.
Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to
determine if these cases could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 14 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 10 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 8 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 5 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 110
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH's daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex

3.  Of the new cases, 93% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.  In the past week (13 July to 19 July), MOH has uncovered links
for 2 previously unlinked cases in the community.
5.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
