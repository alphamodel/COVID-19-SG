    <p>Published Date: 01 Jun 2022</p> <p style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; font-size: medium; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Clementi Polyclinic will be redeveloped at a new site to better serve the needs of residents in and around Clementi. The standalone development will be ready by 2027. A new polyclinic in the Taman Jurong area will also be opened by 2028. Both the redeveloped Clementi Polyclinic and the new polyclinic in Taman Jurong will be operated by the National University Polyclinics (NUP). The details of these polyclinics were announced by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Communications and Information, and Ministry of Health (MOH), at a visit to the existing Clementi Polyclinic on 1 June 2022.<br><strong><br>Redeveloped Clementi Polyclinic</strong><br><br>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-align: left;">The redeveloped Clementi Polyclinic will be located at a vacant site along Commonwealth Avenue West. The site is conveniently located about 250 metres or a a five-minute walk from Clementi MRT Station (refer to&nbsp;</span><u style="text-align: left;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-a941f688b23bb4d6bbcb21b98f27efc30.pdf?sfvrsn=aca425d0_0" title="Annex A">Annex A</a></u><span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;for map). It is about 650 metres away from the existing Clementi Polyclinic at Clementi Avenue 3.<br><br>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">Opened in 1980, Clementi Polyclinic is one of the oldest and smallest polyclinics in Singapore. The redeveloped polyclinic will be larger and will continue to provide a comprehensive range of primary care services, including medical treatment for acute conditions, chronic disease management, allied health services, women’s and children’s health services, as well as radiological, laboratory and pharmacy services.&nbsp;<br><br>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">We have previously started mother-child dyad service pilots at two of our polyclinics (Punggol Polyclinic and Yishun Polyclinic), and will scale this up to 12 more polyclinics, including Clementi Polyclinic, over the next three years. The expanded pilot to provide lactation support for new mothers at NUP will also continue to be offered at the redeveloped polyclinic.<br><br>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">Once redeveloped, the polyclinic will be more spacious and incorporate more elderly-friendly and accessibility features for the convenience of the patients. The existing Clementi Polyclinic will continue to serve residents until the new polyclinic is operational.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left;">New Polyclinic in Taman Jurong<br><br></strong><span style="text-align: left;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">The new polyclinic in Taman Jurong will be located at the site of the former West Point Hospital [1]</span><span style="text-align: left;">, at 235 Corporation Drive (refer to&nbsp;</span><u style="text-align: left;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-bc4705040b68741cc842014288ad91710.pdf?sfvrsn=66f7119c_0" title="Annex B">Annex B</a></u><span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;for map). Together with Pioneer and Jurong Polyclinics, the polyclinic in Taman Jurong will serve residents in Jurong.<br><br>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">The polyclinic in Taman Jurong will incorporate elderly-friendly and accessibility features for the convenience of the patients. It will also provide a comprehensive range of primary care services such as&nbsp;medical treatment for acute conditions, chronic disease management, women’s and children’s health services, allied health services, as well as radiological, laboratory and pharmacy services.&nbsp;<br><br>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">As our population ages and chronic disease burden prevalence increases, it is important that Singaporeans continue to have access to affordable primary care in the community. To strengthen and refresh our public healthcare infrastructure to ensure that they can continue to meet our population’s healthcare needs and be ready in the event of future pandemics, MOH has been strengthening our primary care accessibility and capacity and this includes development of new polyclinics and the redevelopment of existing ones. Singaporeans can look forward to ten new polyclinics over the coming years, in Bidadari, Bishan, Kaki Bukit, Khatib, Sembawang, Serangoon, Taman Jurong, Tampines North, Tengah, and Yew Tee. With these new polyclinics, we will expand our network of polyclinics to 32 [2]</span><span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;by 2030.<br><br></span><strong style="text-align: left;">MINISTRY OF HEALTH&nbsp;</strong></span><strong></strong><strong></strong></p><p class="Default" style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>1 JUNE 2022</strong></span></p><div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br clear="all"></span><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">[1]&nbsp;West Point Hospital ceased operations from September 2018.</span></span></p></div><div id="ftn2"><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">[2] Currently, there are 23 polyclinics, and our target of 32 polyclinics will be achieved after consolidating Bukit Merah Polyclinic and Outram Polyclinic into a larger new polyclinic in Tiong Bahru by 2030.</span></span></p></div></div></body>
