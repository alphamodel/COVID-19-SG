    <title>Covid-19 Vaccination Dose Interval to Be Shortened As National Vaccination Programme Is Accelerated</title>
    <body><h1>Covid-19 Vaccination Dose Interval to Be Shortened As National Vaccination Programme Is Accelerated</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 29 Jun 2021</p> <span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We continue to make steady progress with our national vaccination programme. As of 28 June, we have administered more than 5.3 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Around 3.3 million individuals, or about 60% of our population, have received at least the first dose of the vaccine. 2.1 million individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Take-up rate has been encouraging. As of 28 June 2021, about 76% of eligible seniors aged 60 and above, 78% of eligible persons aged 45 to 59, and 73% of eligible persons aged 40 to 44 have received their COVID-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments. Almost 80% of Singapore Citizens (SC) aged 12-39 years, including MOE students, have also received vaccinations or booked their appointments. Since 24 June, about 50,000 have also brought forward the date of their vaccination appointments for their first dose.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We strongly encourage SCs aged 12-39 years who have not yet registered and booked their appointments to do so quickly, so that they can be protected against COVID-19 as early as possible.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Shortening Dose Interval, Speeding Up Vaccinations</strong><br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On 18 May 2021, we extended the interval between the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccines in our national vaccination programme to an interval of 6 to 8 weeks. This was to maximise first dose coverage within our population. As we confirmed our supply delivery and ramped up our vaccination rate, we expect that the majority of the population in Singapore will have been offered and received their first dose vaccination in the second half of July.&nbsp; By then, we would have achieved our objective of giving as many people as possible good protection.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hence, from <strong>29 June 2021</strong> onwards, we will shorten the minimum interval between the first and second doses of the vaccine from 6 to 8 weeks, to 4 weeks for both the Pfizer-BioNTech / Comirnaty and Moderna vaccines. This will ensure that more of our population can now be fully vaccinated earlier.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All eligible individuals who make their vaccination appointments from <strong>29 June onwards</strong> will be able to schedule their first and second dose appointments 4 weeks apart. Individuals who have already received their first doses, and with second dose appointments currently scheduled 6 to 8 weeks later, can also rebook and bring forward their second dose appointments to 4 weeks from their first dose appointment. They can do so by using the same personalised booking link in the SMS that they had earlier received.&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Given the steady vaccination take-up by Singapore Citizens, and that new registrations from the 12-39 age group has tapered off, we will also bring forward the start date of the national vaccination programme for Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders in Singapore aged 12 to 39 years from the earlier announced date of 2 July 2021 to <strong>30 June 2021</strong>. This will help sustain the momentum of vaccinations and better utilise our delivery capacity.&nbsp; Individuals will be able to register their interest online via vaccine.gov.sg. After registration, they will be progressively invited to book their vaccination appointments via an SMS with a personalised booking link sent to the mobile number they registered with, and can book their set of two appointments, four weeks apart, starting from 30 June onwards.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Keeping Our Community Safe</strong><br><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vaccination remains a key enabler in our fight against COVID-19 and its ability to help Singapore re-open safely can only be felt when we can collectively achieve a high level of population coverage for vaccination. We encourage all to register their interest via vaccine.gov.sg and book their appointments and get vaccinated when they are offered.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong><br>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>29 JUNE 2021</strong><br>&nbsp;<br></span><div><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br></span></div></body>
