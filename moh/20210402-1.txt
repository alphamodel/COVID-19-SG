Amongst the 43 imported cases,

•  1 (Case 61482) is a Singaporean and 5 (Cases 61460, 61464,
61472, 61480 and 61502) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned
from Germany, India and the UK.
•  3 (Cases 61457, 61498 and 61500) are Student's Pass
holders who arrived from India and Myanmar.
•  3 (Cases 61454, 61465 and 61475) are Work Pass holders who
arrived from India and the Philippines.
•  25 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh,
India, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines, of whom 5 (Cases 61440,
61449, 61453, 61488 and 61489) are foreign domestic workers.
•  6 (Cases 61455, 61456, 61461, 61462, 61463 and 61470) are
Short-Term Visit Pass holders. Cases 61455, 61461, 61462, 61463 and
61470 arrived from India, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea for work
projects in Singapore. Case 61456 arrived from Indonesia to visit her
family members who are Singapore Permanent Residents.

They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.

Case 61480 is a 46 year-old female Singapore Permanent Resident who
returned from India on 17 March, and served SHN at a dedicated facility.
Her on-arrival test on 17 March was negative for COVID-19. On 20 March,
she was placed on quarantine as she had been identified as a close
contact of Case 61047 during their flight to Singapore. Her tests done
during quarantine on 21 March and 30 March were negative for COVID-19.
Her quarantine ended on 31 March and she went home, where she had
remained until she sought medical treatment for an unrelated condition
on 1 April. Although she is asymptomatic, she was tested again, and this
time her result came back positive for COVID-19 infection and she was
hospitalised. Her serology test result is pending. Given her recent
travel history and exposure to a COVID-19 case during her flight, we
have classified this as an imported case.

Cases 61461 and 61470 are Short-Term Visit Pass holders who arrived from
Papua New Guinea on 27 March for work projects in Singapore. Both tested
negative for COVID-19 upon arrival in Singapore, and had remained
isolated at a dedicated facility until they tested negative again on 29
March. Thereafter they were on a controlled itinerary, which was largely
limited to their place of work and accommodation. On 30 March, they were
placed on quarantine as they had been identified as close contacts of
Case 61360 during their flight to Singapore. Case 61461 developed a
cough on 30 March night, while Case 61470 is asymptomatic. They were
tested for COVID-19 on 31 March and conveyed to separate hospitals when
their results came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day.
Their serology test results are pending. Given their recent travel
history and exposure to a COVID-19 case during their flight, we have
classified these cases as imported.

4.  Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.

5.  Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

6.  15 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,176 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from

7.  There are currently 40 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 204 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
