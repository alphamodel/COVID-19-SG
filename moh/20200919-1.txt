A) IMPORTED CASES: 5 (1 Work Permit holder, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder, 1
Student’s Pass holder, 2 Long-Term Visit Pass holders)

Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 57700) is a Work Permit holder
currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India on 8 September. 2
(Cases 57691 and 57694) are Long-Term Visit Pass holders who arrived
from India on 6 September. Another case (Case 57689) is a Dependant’s
Pass holder who arrived from Iran on 15 September and the remaining case
(Case 57692) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from India on 6
September.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Singaporean)
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
57699 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to
identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further
spread.
Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the
meantime, all his identified close contacts have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for his household contacts to determine if he
could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 9
Amongst the 9 cases residing in dormitories, 6 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 3 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
2.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.       Of the new cases, 93% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.    Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.    71 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,142 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.       There are currently 27 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 362 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
