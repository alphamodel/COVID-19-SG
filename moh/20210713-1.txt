COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE TESTING AND CLOSURE OF AFFECTED PREMISES
5.   MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst
Vietnamese social hostesses who had frequented KTV lounges or clubs
currently operating as F&B outlets, and their close social contacts. Our
epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing
transmission at the following premises:

-   Club Dolce Pte Ltd (Balestier Point);
-   WU Bistro Pte Ltd (Golden Mile Complex); and
-   Club De Zara Pte Ltd (Textile Centre).

6.     To break any potential chain of transmission and enable deep
cleaning, these premises have been closed to all members of the public
starting from 13 July 2021 to 27 July 2021.
7.     To quickly uncover any community infection cases, we will be
conducting special testing operations for all staff of WU Bistro Pte Ltd
(Golden Mile Complex) andClub De Zara Pte Ltd (Textile Centre).

8.    We will also extend free COVID-19 testing to members of the public
who had:

i) Visited the following premises between 29 June and 13 July 2021:

-   WU Bistro Pte Ltd (Golden Mile Complex) or Club De Zara Pte Ltd
    (Textile Centre); or
-   Similar KTV lounges or clubs operating as F&B outlets.

ii) Interacted with Vietnamese social hostesses in any setting between
29 June and 13 July 2021.
This is in addition to the testing operations announced yesterday for
staff and visitors of Supreme KTV (Far East Shopping Centre), Empress
KTV (Tanglin Shopping Centre) and Club Dolce (Balestier Point). Please
refer to https://go.gov.sg/ktv-testing for details on the testing
operations.

9.     All visitors to these premises and similar settings and those who
had interacted with Vietnamese social hostesses are advised to monitor
their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as
possible, for 14 days from their date of visit or interaction. They are
encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.

CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

10.    94 cases are currently warded in hospital.Most are well and under
observation. There are currently 7 cases of serious illness requiring

11.    There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 22 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 18 are unvaccinated, 4 are partially vaccinated and none was fully
vaccinated.
