Limitations On In-person Visits to Hospitals and Residential Care Homes



LIMITATIONS ON IN-PERSON VISITS TO HOSPITALS AND RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES


Published Date: 12 Oct 2022

        The Ministry of Health (MOH) will be tightening the visitor safe
management measures at all hospital wards¹ and residential care homes
(‘Homes’) for four weeks from 14 October 2022 to 10 November 2022 (both
dates inclusive). This is to protect the healthcare capacity, as well as
vulnerable patients and residents during this period when COVID-19 cases
in the community are rising.
IN-PERSON VISITS AT HOSPITALS
2.     All patients will be allowed only two pre-designated visitors for
the duration of their admission, and only one visitor may be allowed at
the bedside at any one time. Critically ill patients will be allowed up
to five pre-designated patients, and two visitors may be allowed at the
bedside at any one point in time.
3.     The visit duration will be limited to 30 minutes. In exceptional
situations, such as for critically ill patients, paediatric patients,
birthing or post-partum mothers, and for patients requiring additional
care support², visitors may be allowed to stay beyond 30 minutes on a
case-by-case basis at the hospitals’ discretion.
4.     Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards,
or use the toilets designated for patients in the wards. They should
avoid sitting on patients’ beds.
5.     In addition, as our hospitals’ Emergency Departments (ED) are
seeing a high number of patients daily, we encourage members of public
to only go to the ED for emergency conditions. To prioritise ED
resources for patients who need emergency medical care, ED patients with
non-emergency conditions, including children, may be diverted to other
urgent care clinics or primary care clinics for further assessment.
IN-PERSON VISITS AT HOMES
6.     All residents will be allowed up to four pre-designated visitors,
and only one visitor may visit at any one time with the visit duration
limited to 30 minutes. Visitors should continue to schedule the visits
with the Home ahead of time. Visitors should strictly adhere to
prevailing safe management measures within the Homes. This includes
remaining within the designated visitor areas, outside of the wards.
7.     We also seek the understanding of visitors that visits may have
to be suspended if a Home is managing active COVID-19 cases. Next-of-kin
of residents may approach the Home for further details.
8.     Visitors to hospitals and Homes are to ensure that they are well
and are strongly encouraged to test themselves with an antigen rapid
test (ART) kit on the day of the visit to their loved ones. They must
don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These
include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of
fabric. Hospitals and Homes have the discretion to impose stricter
visitor limits or testing requirements for visitors of vulnerable or
unvaccinated patients.
9.      MOH will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line
with the evolving COVID-19 situation. We seek the understanding and
cooperation of patients, residents, and their family members and loved
ones as we work to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our
healthcare institutions.
