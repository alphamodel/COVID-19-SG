As a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all guests, the hotel has stopped accepting new guests since 19 December and is checking out existing guests progressively. Individuals serving SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore have been transported via dedicated vehicles to an alternative SHN dedicated facility. <br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In total, 394 persons serving SNH at the hotel have been swabbed, and 384 test results are ready, while 10 are pending. Of the results that are ready, 381 have come back negative for COVID-19 infection. 3 have tested positive and were immediately conveyed to the hospital via ambulance. As they have recent travel history, it is likely that these are imported and have been included in today\u2019s case count. Nevertheless the National Public Health Laboratory will conduct whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to determine if they could be linked to the 13 cases. It takes about 4 weeks to culture the virus and complete the genome sequencing. <br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MOH has also tested 158 staff of Mandarin Orchard Singapore so far, and all the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test results have come back negative for COVID-19. However the serological tests of 3 staff have come back positive, indicating likely past infections. Epidemiological investigations of these cases are in progress.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>20 DECEMBER 2020</strong></p> </div> <div><br clear=\"all\"> <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"> <div id=\"ftn1\"> <p>[1] Cases 58204, 58235, 58233, 58236, 58237, 58234, 58244, 58245, 58253, 58252, 58268, 58281 and 58284.
