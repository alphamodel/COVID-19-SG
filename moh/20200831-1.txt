A) IMPORTED CASES: 7 (6 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 1 Work Permit
holder)

Amongst the 7 imported cases, 6 (Cases 56859, 56860, 56867, 56868, 56876
and 56881) are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to
Singapore from India between 17 August and 19 August, and Malaysia on 17
August. The remaining case (Case 56880) is a Work Permit holder
currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India on 19 August. All
of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in
Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at dedicated
facilities.

B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3 (1 Work Pass holder, 2 Work Permit holders)

All 3 cases in the community are currently unlinked and were detected as
a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction,
marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories. All
of them are asymptomatic, and were detected through our proactive
testing. The serological test result for Cases 56861 and 56863 have come
back positive, which indicate likely past infection [1]. Epidemiological
investigations of the cases are in progress. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on
quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine
period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct
serological tests for their household contacts to determine if they
could have been infected by them.

Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We
will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 31

Amongst the 31 cases residing in dormitories, 16 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.

The remaining 15 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories and testing of those with acute respiratory infection (ARI)
symptoms. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic
ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts.

Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted
serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or
past infections. The serological test results for 11 cases have come
back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.

2.          Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily
situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please
refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.

3.          Of the new cases, 85% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.

4.           MOH has been informed that a care staff who previously
worked at Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home (148A Silat Avenue) has tested
positive for COVID-19 infection on 30 August 2020 in the Philippines.
Her last day at the nursing home was 26 August, and she had not
displayed any ARI symptoms while she was at work. As a precautionary
measure, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) have worked with
Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home (Silat) to test 90 staff and residents who were
identified as possible contacts of the case. The test results of all 90
individuals have come back negative for COVID-19.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

5.          Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please
refer to Annex B and Annex C for details.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

6.          72 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 55,658 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

7.           There are currently 78 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 1,049 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
