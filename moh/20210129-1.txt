They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.

4.           Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

 5.           Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.

6.         MOH has completed a special testing operation for staff who
have been working from 31 December 2020 at Jewel Changi Airport, and at
the shops and food establishments that are open to the public at Changi
Airport Terminal 3. This was a precautionary measure after whole genome
sequencing and phylogenetic analysis conducted by the National Public
Health Laboratory revealed that 3 previously reported cases (Cases
59028[1], 59340[2] and 59351[3]) tested positive for the B117 variant,
and could be linked. In total, 409 staff were tested and all the results
have come back negative for COVID-19 infection.
