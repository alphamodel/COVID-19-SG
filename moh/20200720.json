Of these, 2 (Cases 48059 and 48102) had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status. The remaining 4 cases (Cases 48041, 48042, 48043 and 48044) are all asymptomatic, and were identified as a result of our periodic screening of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories.<br><br>5 of the community cases are currently unlinked.

In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
