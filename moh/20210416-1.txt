CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2
There are 2 cases in the community today who are currently unlinked.
Case 61988
Case 61988 is a 44 year-old male Indonesian national who is a Short-Term
Visit Pass holder. He arrived from Indonesia on 28 February as caregiver
to his father who was already receiving medical care in Singapore and
had returned for further treatment for a condition that is not related
to COVID-19.
His pre-departure test done in Indonesia on 26 February was negative for
COVID-19, as was his test taken in Singapore on 1 March. He served SHN
at a dedicated facility until 14 March, and his test on 13 March during
SHN was also negative for COVID-19.
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 14 April in preparation for his return to
Indonesia. His test result came back positive on the same day, and he
was conveyed in an ambulance to a hospital. His serology test result is
pending.
Case 61993
Case 61993 is a 34 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass
holder. He is a senior research fellow at the National University of
Singapore but had only gone to work for 1 day on 12 April, when he had
onset of symptoms in the evening while at work.
He had travelled to India from 28 December 2020 to 21 March 2021, and
served SHN at a dedicated facility upon his return to Singapore. His
pre-departure test done in India on 19 March was negative for COVID-19,
and he again tested negative for his on-arrival swab in Singapore on 21
March. While he was serving SHN, he had been identified as a close
contact of Case 61141 during their flight to Singapore, and was placed
on quarantine at a dedicated facility from 24 March to 11 April. His
tests done during quarantine on 25 March, 3 April and 10 April were all
negative for COVID-19 infection.
He developed fatigue on 12 April evening, a sore throat and body aches
on 13 April, and a fever on 14 April. He stayed at home from 13 April,
and only left his residence to seek medical treatment at a polyclinic on
14 April, where he was tested for COVID-19. His test result came back
positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed to the
National Centre for Infectious Diseases in an ambulance. His serology
result has come back negative, indicating that this is a current
infection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by
them.
