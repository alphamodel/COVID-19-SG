In view of the current ICU occupancy rates, we have triggered the next 100 ICU beds, which will be ready next week. While we are able to stand up ICU beds at short notice, the increased load of patients adds strain and pressure on the healthcare system and our healthcare workers. We encourage everyone to get vaccinated if they have not done so, so as to protect themselves and help ease the patient load on the healthcare system. For those who are not vaccinated, we urge them to minimise unnecessary movement and social interactions.</span><br><br><strong><u>Figure 2</u></strong>: Daily Adult ICU Bed Utilisation<br><a href="/images/librariesprovider5/covid-19-chart-(pr)/fig-2_26-oct.png?sfvrsn=5e27e9a4_2"><img src="/images/librariesprovider5/covid-19-chart-(pr)/fig-2_26-oct.png?sfvrsn=5e27e9a4_2" data-displaymode="Original" alt="Fig 2_26 Oct" title="Fig 2_26 Oct" data-openoriginalimageonclick="true" style="float: left;"></a><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;10 more cases, aged between 66 and 98 years, have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
