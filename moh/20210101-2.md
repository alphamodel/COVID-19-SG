    <body><h1>Updates On Border Measures for Travellers From South Africa</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 01 Jan 2021</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the global COVID-19 situation and will be tightening border measures given the deteriorating situation in South Africa. </p> <p><strong>Restricting Travel from South Africa<br><br></strong>2.&nbsp;<strong> </strong>Travellers with recent travel history to South Africa within 14 days prior to departure to Singapore are currently required to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities. Travellers who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents are also required to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure and present a valid negative COVID-19 test result as a condition of approval to enter Singapore.</p><p><p>3.&nbsp; There have been recent reports of a potentially more contagious strain of the COVID-19 virus circulating in South Africa. To reduce the risks of spread to Singapore, we are putting in place new border restrictions for travellers from South Africa for further precaution. From <strong>03 January 2021, 2359 hours</strong>, until further notice:</p></p><p><p>a) All long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to South Africa within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry into Singapore, or transit through Singapore. This restriction will apply to those who have obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore.</p></p><p>b) Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents will be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore [1],&nbsp;at the start of their 14-day SHN. These test requirements do not apply to those who are only transiting through Singapore.<br><br>4.&nbsp; While the strain has been suggested to be more transmissible, there is currently insufficient evidence to determine if this strain is associated with any change in disease severity, antibody response or vaccine efficacy. These aspects are being investigated. MOH will evaluate the data as it emerges and review our border measures accordingly.</p><p><p><strong>Regular Review of Border Measures</strong></p><p>5.&nbsp; As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg" title="" class="" target="">SafeTravel website</a>. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and treatment.</p></p><p><p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;All travellers are reminded to accurately declare their travel history. Strict enforcement actions will be taken against false declarations.</p></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>1 JANUARY 2021</strong></p> </div> <div><br clear="all"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"> <div id="ftn1"> <p>[1] To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport, travellers are strongly encouraged to register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore at https:\\safetravel.changiairport.com/</p> </div> </div></body>
