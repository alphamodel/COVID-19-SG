As of 31 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 396 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:\n<br>\n<br><strong>a) Imported cases: 3 </strong>(2 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 1 Dependant\u2019s Pass holder)\n<br>\n<br>Amongst the 3 imported cases, 2 (Cases 52004 and 52049) are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India on 3 July and 19 July. The remaining case (Case 51921) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from India on 19 July. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN. Case 52004 had additionally been placed on quarantine following her SHN as she had been identified as a contact of previously confirmed cases, and was tested positive for COVID-19 during quarantine. \n<br>\n<br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 3</strong> (1 Work Pass holder, 1 Work Permit holder, 1 Short-Term Visit Pass holder<sup>1</sup>)\n<br>\n<br>Of the 3 cases in the community, 1 was picked up as a result of our proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on quarantine earlier. 2 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected through our proactive testing\n<br>\n<br>1 of the community cases today is linked to previous cases or clusters. Case 52072 had been identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. He was tested during quarantine to determine his status, even though he is asymptomatic. \n<br>\n<br>2 of the community cases are currently unlinked. 1 of the cases (Case 52090) was detected from our proactive screening of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic. His serological test result has come back positive, which indicates likely past infection. The remaining case (Case 51908) was tested under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.\n<br>\n<br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 8 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.\n<br>\n<br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 390</strong>\n<br>\n<br>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers. \n<br>\n<br>2.
