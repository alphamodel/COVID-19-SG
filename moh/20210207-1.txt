CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 60023 is a 43 year-old male Singaporean who is employed by BGC
Group and deployed to work at Changi Airport Terminal 1 and Terminal 3.
His job entails issuing electronic monitoring devices to individuals who
will be serving SHN outside of dedicated facilities, and helping them to
wear the devices. While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield
and gloves.
He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 4 February as
part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His result came back positive
for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance
to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from
RRT – the last being on 22 January – were negative for COVID-19
infection. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating
that this is likely a current infection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including his family members and
co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them.

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
