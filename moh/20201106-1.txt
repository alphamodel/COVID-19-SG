CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.

B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 4
Amongst the 4 imported cases, 3 are currently employed in Singapore. Of
these, 1 (Case 58229) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from France, and
another (Case 58230) is a Work Permit holder who arrived from the
Philippines. The other case (Case 58231), a Short-Term Visit Pass holder
who arrived from the UK, is an engineer on a work project in Singapore.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
The remaining case (Case 58228) is a Special Pass holder who is a crew
member of a ship which arrived from the US. She had not disembarked from
the ship, and was swabbed on board upon arrival in Singapore.
3.      Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
4.      Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
5.      We have completed screening and testing of 5,084 individuals
working at Changi Airport Terminal 3 who may have contact
with travellers. This was a precautionary measure following the
detection of 2 cases (Cases 58125 and 58138) who had worked at the
Terminal. All 5,084 results have come back negative for COVID-19. We are
working with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to facilitate
testing for 33 remaining individuals who have yet to be swabbed. In the
meantime, they have been temporarily suspended from duties until they
are tested negative for COVID-19.
6.      MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at
Tuas South Dormitory (1 Tuas South Street 12) for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

7.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
8.     10 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,959 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
9.      There are currently 36 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 24 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
