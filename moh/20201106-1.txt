Updated Border Measures for Travellers From Estonia and Norway



UPDATED BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM ESTONIA AND NORWAY


Published Date: 06 Nov 2020

                  The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely
monitoring the global COVID-19 situation. As there has been a sharp
increase in cases in Estonia and Norway in the past week, all travellers
entering Singapore from 8 NOVEMBER 2020, 2359 HOURS who have a travel
history in the past 14 days to ESTONIA AND NORWAY will be required to
serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities, even
if they have obtained approval to opt out earlier.

2.  This is revised from our announcement on 27 October 2020
that travellers from Estonia and Norway were allowed to serve their
14-day SHN at a suitable place of residence.

3.  Travellers from Fiji, Finland, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey are still allowed to apply to opt out of
dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of
residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:

a.  Travelled to no other country/region than above-mentioned
countries[1], in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and

b.  Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address)
alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN
with the same travel history and duration of SHN.

The COVID-19 tests will continue to be administered before the end of
the SHN.

4.  As the global situation evolves, we will continue to
adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and
transmission to the community. Any changes to border measures will be
updated on the Safe Travel Office website[2]. Travellers are advised to
visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before
entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing
border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at
dedicated SHN facilities, tests and treatment.

5.  All travellers are reminded to accurately declare their
travel history. Strict enforcement actions will be taken against false
declarations.
