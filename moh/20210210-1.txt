OVER 1,000 GENERAL PRACTITIONER CLINICS OPEN DURING CHINESE NEW YEAR HOLIDAYS


Published Date: 10 Feb 2021

       1,033 general practitioner (GP) clinics, of which 758 are Public
Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), will be open at various times
during the Chinese New Year public holidays from 11 February to 14
February 2021. The public may access the latest list of GP clinics and
their operating hours through:



-   MOH’s corporate website
-   MOH’s Directory of Licensed Healthcare Institutions;
-   The Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC) website;
-   Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) webpage; and
-   HealthHub mobile application, which is available on both iTunes and
    the Google Play Store.
-   phpc.gov.sg for the list of PHPCs



2.    We encourage members of the public who feel unwell during the
festivities to visit their GP or a 24-hour clinic for minor,
self-limiting conditions. We advise the public to seek medical treatment
at a hospital’s Accident & Emergency (A&E) department only for serious
or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness, and
uncontrollable bleeding.
3.   Members of the public who develop symptoms of acute respiratory
infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose) as well as fever
and loss of taste or smell, are strongly encouraged to visit a PHPC and
get tested early when advised by their doctor. 490 PHPCs will be able to
provide polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swabs for COVID-19 for at least
one day during the Chinese New Year period.
4.   Six Regional Screening Centres across the island will also
continue to operate during their normal hours (10am to 4pm daily) and
take patients who have been referred for a swab by their doctor. It is
important to test for COVID-19 early for early detection, management and
containment to prevent further spread of the disease, to help protect
our loved ones and vulnerable members of the community.
5.   The Ministry of Health (MOH) wishes everyone a happy Chinese New
Year and a healthy year ahead. MOH would also like to take this
opportunity to remind the public to eat in moderation and continue
exercising regularly to stay healthy over the holiday period.
