CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today who is currently
unlinked.
Case 60125 is a 22 year-old male Bangladesh national who works as a
construction worker, and resides in a dormitory located at Bedok South
Road. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 7
February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test
result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and he was
immediately isolated. An individual test was done on 9 February, and his
test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day.
He was subsequently conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 24
January – were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result
has come back positive but we are unable to rule out that this could be
a recent infection. As a precautionary measure, all his close contacts
at the dormitory and his workplace have been placed on quarantine.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 14
Amongst the 14 imported cases,
• 1 (Case 60132) is a Singaporean and 2 (Cases 60118 and 60128) are
Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India, Malaysia and the
UK.
• 1 (Case 60113) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from the US.
• 2 (Cases 60119 and 60121) are Work Pass holders who arrived from
Brazil and Russia.
• 6 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India, Indonesia, Myanmar
and the Philippines, of whom 4 (Cases 60105, 60114, 60120, and 60135)
are foreign domestic workers.
• 2 (Cases 60115 and 60116) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders. Case
60115 arrived from Indonesia to visit her Singaporean family members,
and Case 60116 arrived from the UAE for a work project in Singapore.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
4.    Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.        Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.      20 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,526 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.         There are currently 36 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 156 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
