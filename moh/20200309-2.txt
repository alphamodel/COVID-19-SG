LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
3. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was
made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
a) Eight of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38,
83, 90, 91, 138 and 151), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The
Life Church and Missions Singapore. These cases are linked to another 23

67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84, 88) who are linked to the Grace

5. Contact tracing is underway for the other 14 locally transmitted
cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to
affected countries or regions.
PRIORITISATION OF RESOURCES AT PUBLIC HOSPITALS
6. In view of the rising number of COVID-19 infections globally, and the
expected rise in the number of confirmed cases in Singapore, we will
need to prioritise the resources at our public hospitals.
7. From 7 March 2020, foreigners who are short-term visit pass holders
(STVP) who seek treatment for COVID-19 in Singapore will need to pay for
their treatment. MOH will continue to waive COVID-19 testing fees for
all STVP holders as part of our public health measures to identify and
initiate contact tracing for confirmed cases who may have been
infectious while in Singapore.
8. The government will continue to pay for the COVID-19 testing fees and
hospital bill in full for Singapore Residents and long term pass holders
who are admitted to public hospitals for COVID-19.

all non-essential travel to mainland China, Iran, northern Italy, Japan
and the Republic of Korea.
46. All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks
upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they
feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.
47. Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following
precautions at all times:
• Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of
illness;
• Observe good personal hygiene;
• Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or
eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory
secretions after coughing or sneezing);
• Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
shortness of breath;
• Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
• Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.
48. MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical
practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely
to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
