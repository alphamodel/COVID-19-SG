Covid-19 Vaccine



EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION ENDORSES USE OF PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE


Published Date: 14 Dec 2020

PRESS RELEASE BY THE EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION
1. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination welcomes the interim
authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine by the Health
Sciences Authority (HSA), for use in Singapore in individuals aged 16
years and above to prevent COVID-19 disease, in view of the pandemic
conditions globally.
2. The Expert Committee has reviewed the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine’s
safety and efficacy data for different population segments in Singapore,
and been briefed by HSA on its full range of considerations in granting
interim authorisation, and is thus satisfied with its safety and
efficacy. The vaccine demonstrated a high vaccine efficacy of 95%, and
its safety profile is consistent with the high standards set for other
registered vaccines used in the immunisation against other diseases. We
agree with HSA’s recommendation for the suitability of its use in
individuals aged 16 years and above in Singapore. However pregnant
women, immuno-compromised persons and those under the age of 16 should
not receive the vaccine yet, until more data is available.
3. The Expert Committee further recommends that Singapore should achieve
as comprehensive a coverage of COVID-19 vaccination as possible across
its entire population, and everyone who is medically eligible should be
vaccinated, although vaccination should remain voluntary.
4. As vaccine supply will arrive in Singapore in batches over several
months as manufacturers ramp up their production of vaccines, we
recommend that vaccination should start with groups who are at greater
risk and hence most in need of COVID-19 vaccination, including
healthcare workers and COVID-19 frontline workers, as well as vulnerable
groups at greater risk of severe disease from COVID-19 infection, such
as the elderly.
5. We will provide further details regarding our complete set of
recommendations to the government on the use and priority groups for
vaccination in the coming weeks.
