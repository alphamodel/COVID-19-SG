(Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty and Moderna), covering 4,453,578 individuals,
with 4,186,252 individuals having completed the full vaccination
regimen.
2.     In addition, 153,913 doses of other vaccines recognised in the
World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been
administered as of 18 August 2021, covering 84,219 individuals. In

4. There is continuing evidence that almost all
fully-vaccinated individuals do not suffer serious disease when
infected, unless if they had underlying medical conditions that made
them more susceptible. Over the last 28 days, the percentage of
unvaccinated who became severely ill or died is 9.1%, while that for the
fully vaccinated is 1.7%.
