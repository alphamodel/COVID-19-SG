    <p>Published Date: 01 Sep 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 1 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 40 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>Summary of new cases<br></strong><br>Amongst the new cases today, 37 are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance, while 3 were symptomatic.&nbsp;<br></span></span></p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="241" valign="top"> <p>&nbsp;</p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"> </span></td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Already in quarantine/ isolation before detection </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Detected from surveillance </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Total</strong></span></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="241" valign="top"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Imported cases</strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">7</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">0</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">7</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="241" valign="top"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Cases in the community </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">0</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">1</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">1</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="241" valign="top"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Cases residing in dormitories </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">22</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">10</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">32</span></p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 7</strong> (3 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 2 Work Pass holders, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder, 1 Short-Term Visit Pass holder)<br><br>Amongst the 7 imported cases, 3 (Cases 56916, 56915 and 56917) are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India on 16 August, and the US on 18 August. 2 cases (Cases 56913 and 56918) are&nbsp; Work Pass holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Bangladesh and Brazil on 16 August. Another case (Case 56911) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from Bangladesh on 16 August. The remaining case (Case 56919) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder whose parents are Singapore Permanent Residents. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 1</strong> (1 Work Pass holder)<br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 56899 was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories. She was asymptomatic, and was detected through our proactive testing. Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for her household contacts to determine if she could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 32<br></strong><br>Amongst the 32 cases residing in dormitories, 22 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 10 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories and testing of those with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections. <span style="font-size: 12px;"><sup>[1]</sup></span> The serological test results for 9 cases have come back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

In all, 55,749 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are currently 86 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 990 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>1 SEPTEMBER 2020</strong><br><br>==<br><span style="font-size: 12px;">[1]&nbsp;Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective to others.</span></span></span></p></body>
