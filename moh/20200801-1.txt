1.      As of 1 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 307 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 5 (2 Work Pass holders, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders, 1
Long-Term Visit Pass holder)
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 2 (Cases 52303 and 52352) are Work Pass
holders who are currently employed in Singapore, and had arrived from
the Philippines on 29 July and India on 20 July. Another 2 (Cases 52321

placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and
were tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 (1 Singaporean)
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
52334 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify
infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 7 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 301
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
