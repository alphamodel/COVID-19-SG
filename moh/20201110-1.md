&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained low, with a total of 2 cases in the past week. Both cases are currently unlinked. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>Case Details<br></strong><br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 1<br></strong><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 58262 was last at work as a cleaner on 2 November. He developed symptoms a day later, and sought medical treatment at a General Practitioner clinic, where he was tested for COVID-19 under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with ARI at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 1<br></strong><br>There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today. He was detected through our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts. His serological test result has come back positive, which indicates likely past infection.<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 7<br></strong><br>Amongst the 7 imported cases, 1 (Case 58257) is a Singaporean and another (Case 58258) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from Uzbekistan and Indonesia respectively. Another 2 (Cases 58259 and 58260) are Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Indonesia. The next case (Case 58261) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from the UAE. The remaining cases are Short-Term Visit Pass holders. Case 58252 is on a work project in Singapore while Case 58253’s spouse is a Singaporean.&nbsp;<br><br>They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the <a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/moh-press-release---annex-a-and-b-(10-nov-2020).pdf?sfvrsn=60c54004_0" title="Annexes">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH’s daily Situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,985 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are currently 40 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 20 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>10 NOVEMBER 2020</strong></span></span></p></body>
