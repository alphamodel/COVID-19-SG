CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 60277 is a 59 year-old female Singaporean who works at Aibel Pte
Ltd in an administrative role, and has been working from home since
March 2020.
She developed an itchy throat on 4 February and sought medical treatment
at a general practitioner clinic. She was placed on 5 days of medical
leave, and told to return for a follow-up consultation and COVID-19 test
if she had not recovered after 3 days. She informed her doctor on 6
February that she had recovered. On 15 February, she developed fever,
chills, nausea and epigastric pain, and sought treatment at Sengkang
General Hospital, where she was tested for COVID-19, and isolated. Her
test result come back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her
serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is
likely a current infection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including her family members,
have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the
start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close
contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
