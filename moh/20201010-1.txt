2.     Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained
stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an
average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
3.     Of the new cases, 86% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is a family member of
previously confirmed cases. Case 58015 had been identified as a contact
of Cases 57890 and 57945, and had been placed on quarantine earlier.
Cases 57890 and 57945 had arrived from Indonesia on 25 September, and
were granted permission to serve SHN at home as Case 57945 is a 2-month
old infant. As a precautionary measure, Case 58015 was placed on SHN as
well due to his exposure to them, even though he had not travelled with
his family. He had not left his place of residence since. He
subsequently developed symptoms during quarantine and was tested
positive for COVID-19 infection.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory who was detected through our
bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories.
This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so
that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 5
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 58018) is a Singapore Permanent
Resident and 1 (Case 58019) is a Singaporean who returned from Belarus
and Qatar respectively. Another case (Case 58020) is currently employed
in Singapore who arrived from France. The remaining 2 cases (Cases 58013
and 58014) are sea crew who arrived in Singapore to board a ship docked
here. They were conveyed directly from the airport to the ship in a
dedicated vehicle upon arrival in Singapore, and had not left the ship
subsequently.
They had all been placed on 14-day SHN upon arrival in Singapore, and
were tested while serving SHN even though all of them are asymptomatic.
4.     Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
5.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
6.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.     23 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,698 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.     There are currently 40 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 101 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
