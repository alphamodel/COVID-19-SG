    <body><h1>24 Private Healthcare Institutions Selected to Administer the Government's Stock of Sinovac-coronavac Covid-19 Vaccine</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 16 Jun 2021</p> <span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Ministry of Health (MOH) has selected 24 private healthcare institutions licensed under the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (PHMCA) to be licensed providers of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine under the Special Access Route (SAR). These providers will draw from MOH's existing stock, and can administer the vaccine to Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and persons holding Long-Term Passes who wish to take the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MOH reviewed the applications based on the providers' ability to administer the vaccines safely, properly and efficiently. MOH also considered the providers' proposed vaccination administration fees, experience in vaccine administration and its compliance history at past licensing inspections, so as to ensure that the services will be safe and affordable to members of public.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The list of selected providers and their vaccination administration fee per dose of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine is listed in <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-a-(1).pdf?sfvrsn=2dcfc975_0" title="Annex A ">Annex A </a></span>. As these vaccines are being provided to the providers at no cost, individuals should take note that the providers should not charge them for the vaccine cost. The vaccination administration fees listed is also inclusive of consultation and 7% GST, so there should not be any additional costs (beyond the vaccination administration fees listed) charged by these providers. Interested individuals may contact these providers directly from 18 June 2021 for more details on how they may receive the vaccine.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine remains unregistered and is not authorised by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for use under the Pandemic Special Access Route, it is to be provided only under the SAR framework, and hence will not be covered under the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP) meant for our national vaccination programme. Individuals who nevertheless wish to receive Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccinations under the SAR framework should discuss with their doctors in the selected private healthcare institutions the risks and benefits of using the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, and jointly make an informed decision.<br><br><br>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>16 JUNE 2021</span></body>
