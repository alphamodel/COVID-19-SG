Novavax Nuvaxovid Covid-19 Vaccine Authorised for Use In National
Vaccination Programme



NOVAVAX NUVAXOVID COVID-19 VACCINE AUTHORISED FOR USE IN NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAMME


Published Date: 14 Feb 2022

       The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has accepted the recommendation of
the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination to include the Nuvaxovid
COVID-19 vaccine (Nuvaxovid) by Novavax in the National Vaccination
Programme for use in individuals aged 18 years and above, for both
COVID-19 primary and booster vaccination. This follows the Health
Sciences Authority's (HSA) interim authorisation of the vaccine under
the Pandemic Special Access Route.
2.    The first batch of the Nuvaxovid vaccine is expected to arrive in
Singapore in the next few months if there are no disruptions to the
shipment schedule. We will roll out the Nuvaxovid vaccine for
individuals aged 18 years and above when shipments of the vaccine
arrive. More details will be shared later.
3.    In the meantime, we encourage those who are medically eligible not
to delay their vaccinations and boosters, and to take the mRNA vaccines
available in our National Vaccination Programme as this will provide
timely and effective protection against COVID-19.
