MOH REPLY IN RESPONSE TO MEDIA QUERIES ON REPORTS OF NEW VARIANT IN SINGAPORE


Published Date: 18 May 2021

The Ministry of Health refers to the reports published by Hindustan
Times on 18 May 2021 ("Coronavirus variant found in Singapore can be
India's 3rd wave, extremely dangerous for kids, warns Arvind Kejriwal")
and NDTV on 18 May 2021 (“Stop Singapore Flights: Arvind Kejriwal To
Centre Over New Covid Strain”).



There is no truth whatsoever in the assertions found within the reports.
There is no “Singapore variant”. The strain that is prevalent in many of
the COVID-19 cases in recent weeks is the B.1.617.2 variant, which
originated in India. Phylogenetic testing has shown this B.1.617.2
variant to be associated with several clusters in Singapore.
