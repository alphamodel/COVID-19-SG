The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 3</strong> (1 Singaporean, 2 Work Pass holders)<br><br>Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 55143) is a Singaporean who returned to Singapore from India on 25 July. The remaining 2 (Cases 55138 and 55142) are Work Pass holders who are currently employed in Singapore. They arrived in Singapore from India on 26 July. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 1</strong>&nbsp; (1 Singaporean)<br><br>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 55169 was tested after she sought medical treatment for prolonged acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 171</strong><br><br>The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in the dormitories on 7 August, and some of the test results are still being processed. There are currently about 23,500 workers who are still serving out their isolation period at quarantine facilities. These workers will be tested when their isolation ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
