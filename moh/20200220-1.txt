LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

3.            Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing
have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This
was made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.

 

-   Four of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33, 38
    and 83), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and
    Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road).

    and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).
-   Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to the
    private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22
    January.

    to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.

    62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81 and 84) are linked to
    the Grace Assembly of God.

Province and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.

 

 

17.             All travellers should monitor their health closely for
two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly
if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their
travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g.
cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic
ahead of the visit.

 

 

18.           Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times: 

 

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating,

    after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory
    secretions after coughing or sneezing);

-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

     

20.          MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is
likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
