Another 6 (Cases 57114, 57118, 57125, 57126, 57129 and 57132) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from India on 25 August, Indonesia on 24 August and 25 August, and the Philippines on 23 August and 25 August.

Case 57147 had been identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. Case 57131 is linked to the cluster at CDPL Tuas Dormitory, and was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories.<br><br>The other 2 community cases are currently unlinked. Both (Cases 57139 and 57149) were detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing, even though they are asymptomatic.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 3 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week.

They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 18 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections.<sup>1</sup> The serological test result for 1 case has come back positive so far, which indicates likely past infection.<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
