The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 2</strong> (2 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents)<br><br>Both the imported cases today are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents who returned to Singapore from India on 6 August and 8 August. They had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN.<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases in the community today.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of fewer than 1 per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 66<br></strong><br>The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in the dormitories. There are currently about 14,500 workers who are still serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when their quarantine ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
