    <body><h1>519 More Cases Discharged, 61 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 11 Aug 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 11 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 61 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 3</strong> (2 Long-Term Visit Pass holders, 1 Dependant’s Pass holder)<br><br>Amongst the 3 imported cases, 2 (Cases 55403 and 55408) are Long-Term Visit Pass holders who arrived from India on 28 July and 29 July.&nbsp; The remaining case (Case 55415) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from India on 30 July. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 2</strong> (2 Singaporeans)<br><br>Both of the community cases today are linked to previous cases. Cases 55381 and 55382 are family members who had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases. They had been placed on quarantine, and were tested when they reported having symptoms.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 56</strong><br><br>The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in the dormitories. There are currently about 22,500 workers who are still serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when their isolation ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
