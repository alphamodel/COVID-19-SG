CASE DETAILS
A)    CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B)   CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C)   IMPORTED CASES: 5
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 58763) is a Singapore Permanent
Resident who returned from Ukraine. The remaining 4 are Work Permit
holders who arrived from Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, of
whom 3 (Cases 58761, 58764 and 58765) are foreign domestic workers. They
had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were
tested while serving SHN.
Case 58762 served SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore before she was
transferred to another dedicated facility on 20 December when MOH
commenced investigations into 13 previously reported cases who had
served SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore between 22 October and 11
November 2020. She was swabbed on 19 December and 21 December and her
test results were negative for COVID-19 infection. Her swab on 24
December at the end of SHN came back positive, and she was conveyed to
the hospital the next day. A confirmatory test by the National Public
Health Laboratory (NPHL) was also positive. However a second sample
taken by NPHL on 26 December came back negative, and her serological
test result has also come back negative. Investigations are ongoing to
assess if she could be linked to the 13 cases.
3.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
4.     Please refer to the Annexes and MOHâ€™s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     8 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,370 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
6.    There are currently 31 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 94 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These
are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test
positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to
COVID-19 infection.
7.     Singapore will enter into Phase Three of re-opening on 28
December. As more activities resume in the community, adherence to the
safe management and safe distancing measures becomes even more critical
in mitigating spread and keeping community transmission low. Let us
continue to keep our guard up and be disciplined in our fight against
COVID-19, so that we can remain safe as we transit to Phase Three.
