3.     Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
5.     MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at
Cassia @ Penjuru (15 Penjuru Walk) for the past two incubation periods
(i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed. With the closure of
this cluster, there are no active COVID-19 clusters for the first time
since 3 February 2020.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     8 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,079 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 37 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 39 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
