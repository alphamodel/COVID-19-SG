His job entails loading and unloading of goods, and he does not interact with clients.<br><br>He was detected when his pooled COVID-19 test taken on 21 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) came back positive. An individual swab was done on 22 February, and he started to develop a sore throat and cough on the same day. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 22 February, and was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 7 February – were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.<br><br>Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including his dormitory and workplace contacts, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>c)&nbsp;Imported cases: 3<br><br></strong>Amongst the 3 imported cases,<br></span></p> <ul><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">1 (Case 60423) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from the UAE and UK.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">1 (Case 60430) is a Work Permit holder who arrived from the Philippines and is a foreign domestic worker.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">1 (Case 60427) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from India to visit his family members who are Singapore Permanent Residents.<br></span></li></ul><p><span style="font-size: 16px;">They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annexes-23-feb.pdf?sfvrsn=7468108e_0" title="Annexes">Annexes</a></span> and MOH’s daily Situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report" title="" class="" target=""><span style="text-decoration: underline;">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</span></a>) for details.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;7 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
