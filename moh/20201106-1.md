    <body><h1>No New Cases of Locally Transmitted  Covid-19 Infection [6 Nov] </h1>
    <p>Published Date: 06 Nov 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 6 November 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified that there are no new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. There are 4 imported cases, who had already been placed on Stay-Home Notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. All new cases today are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Summary of new cases</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="605"> <tbody><tr> <td width="129"> <p align="right">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="60"> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="192" colspan="2"> <p align="center"><strong>Breakdown by</strong></p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="192" colspan="2"> <p align="center"><strong>Breakdown by</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129"> <p align="right">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="60"> <p><strong>Number of cases</strong></p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p><strong>Already in quarantine/ isolation before detection</strong></p> </td> <td width="96"> <p><strong>Detected from surveillance</strong></p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p>&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p><strong>Symptomatic</strong></p> </td> <td width="96"> <p><strong>Asymptomatic</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129"> <p><strong>Cases in the community</strong></p> </td> <td width="60"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129"> <p><strong>Cases residing in dormitories</strong></p> </td> <td width="60"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129"> <p><strong>Imported cases</strong></p> </td> <td width="60"> <p align="center">4</p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">4</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">0</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">4</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="129"> <p><strong>Total</strong></p> </td> <td width="60"> <p align="center">4</p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="16" valign="top"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> <td width="96"> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained low, with a total of 1 case in the past week, who is currently unlinked. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><p><strong>Case Details<br><br>a)&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cases in the community: 0<br><br></strong>There are no cases in the community today.</p><p><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0&nbsp;<br><br></strong>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Imported cases: 4&nbsp;<br><br></strong>Amongst the 4 imported cases, 3 are currently employed in Singapore. Of these, 1 (Case 58229) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from France, and another (Case 58230) is a Work Permit holder who arrived from the Philippines. The other case (Case 58231), a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from the UK, is an engineer on a work project in Singapore. They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN. <br><br>The remaining case (Case 58228) is a Special Pass holder who is a crew member of a ship which arrived from the US. She had not disembarked from the ship, and was swabbed on board upon arrival in Singapore.&nbsp; <br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>). <br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them. <br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have completed screening and testing of 5,084 individuals working at Changi Airport Terminal 3 who may have contact with&nbsp;travellers. This was a precautionary measure following the detection of 2 cases (Cases 58125 and 58138) who had worked at the Terminal. All 5,084 results have come back negative for COVID-19. We are working with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore to facilitate testing for 33 remaining individuals who have yet to be swabbed. In the meantime, they have been temporarily suspended from duties until they are tested negative for COVID-19. <br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the cluster at Tuas South Dormitory (1 Tuas South Street 12) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></p></p><p><p>7.&nbsp;<b> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
