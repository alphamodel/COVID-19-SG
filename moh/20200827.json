Another 2 (Cases 56642 and 56649) are Dependant\u2019s Pass and Long-Term Pass holders who arrived from India on 15 August and China on 16 August. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN. <br><br>The remaining case (Case 56621) is a seaman who is a Special Pass holder. He arrived in Singapore from India on 8 August on a vessel, where he had not disembarked from. As he had been identified as a close contact of previous cases on the same vessel earlier announced by MOH, he had been placed on quarantine and was tested during quarantine to determine his status.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cases in the community: 2 (2 Singaporeans)&nbsp;<br><br></strong>Both cases in the community were detected under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread. <br><br>1 of the cases today is linked to a previous case. Epidemiological investigations found that Case 56626 had visited SLR Revolution at Excelsior Shopping Centre (5 Coleman Street) on 17 August 2020 and may have had contact with Case 56184, who had gone to work at the shop during his infectious period. The risk of infection for visitors is assessed to be low. However as a precautionary measure, MOH will be contacting all individuals who had visited the shop between 15 August and 18 August, and facilitating COVID-19 testing for them. Those who are unwell when contacted will be conveyed to the hospital for further medical assessment. We advise all visitors to SLR Revolution at Excelsior Shopping Centre during the affected dates to monitor their health and seek medical attention promptly should they develop acute respiratory infection symptoms. They may call MOH at 1800-333-9999 if they have queries. <br><br>The other community case (Case 56627) is currently unlinked. Epidemiological investigations of the case are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for his household contacts to determine if he could have been infected by them. <br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 1 case per day in the week before, to an average of 2 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 1 case <span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">per day in the past 2 weeks.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Cases residing in dormitories: 70&nbsp;<br><br></strong>Amongst the 70 cases residing in dormitories, 66 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 4 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories and testing of those with ARI symptoms. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections.&nbsp;[1]&nbsp;<sup></sup></span><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">The serological test results for 8 cases have come back positive so far, which indicate likely past infections.&nbsp;<br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br></span>2.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
