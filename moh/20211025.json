The Ministry of Health (MOH) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) advise members of the public to activate 995 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) only for life-threatening emergencies.<br><br>2. Between 15 and 21 October 2021, SCDF 995 Operations Centre received about 5,500 calls for medical assistance. Approximately 20% of the calls were from COVID-19 patients. They were conveyed to the nearest Emergency Department (ED). Of these COVID-19 patients conveyed to the ED, about 47% received only day treatment at the ED and did not need to be hospitalised. Additionally, 15% were warded for 2 days or less, and mainly for observation.<br><br>3. SCDF 995 EMS caters to the conveyance of both COVID-19 and non-COVID patients who suffer from life threatening and emergency conditions.<sup>1&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup><br><br>4. To ensure that the 995 EMS is able to provide responsive conveyance for those with emergency conditions, we advise individuals who are not experiencing life-threatening emergencies to refrain from calling 995.<br><br>5. Individuals who have tested positive in their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and are recovering at home under the Home Recovery Programme or awaiting conveyance to a care or isolation facility, but who are experiencing only mild symptoms, are advised to seek medical help via the following channels:<br><br>a. A telemedicine provider (<a href=\"https://go.gov.sg/telemedicineproviders\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">go.gov.sg/telemedicineproviders</a>);&nbsp;<br>b. Their regular primary care provider; or<br>c. The HR Buddy hotline (6874 4939).<br><br>6.
