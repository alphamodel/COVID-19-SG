MOH had earlier announced the suspension of in-person visits to hospitals and Homes until 20 March 2022 (inclusive). While the daily number of local COVID-19 cases has fallen gradually over the past week, our hospitals continue to face a high volume of patients and our healthcare workers are still under significant stress. As such, to relieve pressure on our hospital staff, and our nursing home staff who are caring for COVID-positive residents on-site, in-person visits to hospital wards and Homes will continue to be suspended until 3 April 2022 (inclusive).<br><br>3. Hospitals and Homes have the discretion to allow visits for exceptional cases (e.g. if patient or resident is critically ill) and such visitors will continue to be subject to prevailing visitor management measures (see <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex---18-mar-2022.pdf?sfvrsn=43a4d567_0\" title=\"Annex\">Annex</a>&nbsp;for details). To help patients and residents remain connected with their loved ones with the extended suspension, hospitals and Homes will continue to support alternative methods of communication such as through telephone or video calls.<br><br>4. We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients/residents, and their family members and loved ones. MOH will review and calibrate these measures as the situation evolves.<br><br>[1] Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals.<br>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "extension-of-the-suspension-of-in-person-visits-to-hospitals-and-residential-care-homes-18mar2022", "CurrentPageUrl": null, "CustomPressWidgetLocationUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
