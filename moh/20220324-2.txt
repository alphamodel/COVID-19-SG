Deaths In Singapore for Year 2021



DEATHS IN SINGAPORE FOR YEAR 2021


Published Date: 24 Mar 2022

              The age-standardised death rate¹ five years ago, in 2017,
was 560 per 100,000 persons. This has been decreasing steadily to 518
per 100,000 in 2020, even though 2020 was a COVID-19 year. However, in
2021, the age-standardised death rate rose to 557 per 100,000 persons,
comparable to that in 2017 (refer to the Annex).



2.  The increase is not unexpected, given that the COVID-19
pandemic has been a health crisis which has killed many millions of
people in the world. Singapore, however, has recorded one of the lowest
rates of excess deaths2 in the COVID-19 pandemic from international
comparisons so far.



3.  The total excess deaths due to COVID-19 will require
further analysis and breakdown of the numbers. We are still undergoing
the Omicron wave. When this wave subsides, the Ministry of Health plans
to consolidate the data, and provide a fuller report and analysis on
excess deaths due to COVID-19.

[1] The _age-standardised death rate_ is a summary indicator that
removes the influence of the population’s age structure.
[2] _Excess deaths_ refers to the increase in rates or counts of deaths
from all causes during a period of crisis compared to that expected
under normal conditions.
