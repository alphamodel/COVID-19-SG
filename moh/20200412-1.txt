32 More Cases Discharged; 233 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed



32 MORE CASES DISCHARGED; 233 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 12 Apr 2020

                32 more cases[i] of COVID-19 infection have been
discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 560
have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities.
2.             As of 12 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH)
has confirmed and verified an additional 233 cases of COVID-19 infection
in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

a)   Imported cases: 0
b)   Linked to known clusters: 51
c)   Linked to other cases: 15
d)   Pending contact tracing: 167, of which 16 are Singapore Citizens/
Permanent Residents and 10 are Work Pass or Long Term Pass holders
residing in our community; and 141 are Work Permit holders, mostly
residing in dormitories, work sites and other living quarters.



3.             We have provided a breakdown of the trend of daily cases
based on the different transmission types (see Annex A). As seen from
the chart, the number of imported cases rose around mid-March due to the
large number of returnees but has since come down to zero. The number of
cases in the community increased following the wave of new imported
cases, but there has been some moderation in recent days, in light of
the safe-distancing measures that have been put in place earlier. The
number of work permit and dormitory-related cases has also increased
sharply, and this is likely to continue going up, especially as we
undertake more aggressive testing at the dormitories.
4.             Contact tracing and investigation are underway for
currently unlinked cases to establish any links to known clusters or
previous cases. In the past week (5 April to 11 April), MOH has
uncovered links for 229 previously unlinked cases.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
