UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

the infection and have been discharged from hospital. Of the 221
confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving.
15 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

 

UPDATE ON CONTACT TRACING FOR CONFIRMED CASES

8.            Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once
identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a
precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their
last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts
who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

9.            As of 19 March 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 6,574 close
contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 2,273 are currently
quarantined, and 4,301 have completed their quarantine.

HEALTH ADVISORY

10.         Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel abroad.

11.         All travellers should monitor their health closely for two
weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if
they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.

12.         Travellers and members of the public should adopt the
following precautions at all times:

·         Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing
symptoms of illness;
·         Observe good personal hygiene;
·         Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling
food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by
respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing);
·         Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough
or shortness of breath;
·         Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or
sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin
immediately; and
·         Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

13.         MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As
medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is
likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
