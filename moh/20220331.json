As the daily number of local COVID-19 cases has fallen, and the situation in our hospitals and Homes is starting to improve, <strong>in-person visits to hospital wards and Homes will resume from 4 April 2022</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As hospitals and Homes are settings with vulnerable patients/residents, visitors will have to comply with the safe management measures (SMMs) to better protect the patient/resident.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In-person visits are only allowed for individuals (i.e. patients, residents and visitors) who are fully vaccinated. As a concession, we will allow visits for individuals (i.e. patients, residents and visitors) who are medically ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination. Under exceptional circumstances, hospitals and Homes may also exercise flexibility in their visitor policies on a case-by-case basis.

We seek their continued cooperation to comply with the SMMs to keep patients/ residents safe as in-person visits are resumed. MOH will review and calibrate these measures as the situation evolves.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>31 MARCH 2022</strong><br><div><br><sup>1</sup> Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals.<br></div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "resumption-of-in-person-visits-to-hospitals-and-residential-care-homes", "CurrentPageUrl": null, "CustomPressWidgetLocationUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
