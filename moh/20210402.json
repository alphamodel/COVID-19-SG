Her on-arrival test on 17 March was negative for COVID-19. On 20 March, she was placed on quarantine as she had been identified as a close contact of Case 61047 during their flight to Singapore. Her tests done during quarantine on 21 March and 30 March were negative for COVID-19. Her quarantine ended on 31 March and she went home, where she had remained until she sought medical treatment for an unrelated condition on 1 April. Although she is asymptomatic, she was tested again, and this time her result came back positive for COVID-19 infection and she was hospitalised. Her serology test result is pending. Given her recent travel history and exposure to a COVID-19 case during her flight, we have classified this as an imported case.<br></p><p>Cases 61461 and 61470 are Short-Term Visit Pass holders who arrived from Papua New Guinea on 27 March for work projects in Singapore. Both tested negative for COVID-19 upon arrival in Singapore, and had remained isolated at a dedicated facility until they tested negative again on 29 March. Thereafter they were on a controlled itinerary, which was largely limited to their place of work and accommodation. On 30 March, they were placed on quarantine as they had been identified as close contacts of Case 61360 during their flight to Singapore. Case 61461 developed a cough on 30 March night, while Case 61470 is asymptomatic. They were tested for COVID-19 on 31 March and conveyed to separate hospitals when their results came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Their serology test results are pending.
