FIVE MORE CASES DISCHARGED; TWO NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 17 Feb 2020

       Five more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospital today (Cases 14, 15, 31, 48 and 65). In all, 24 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.

2  As of 17 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified two additional cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. Of these, one was among the group of Singaporeans who were
evacuated from Wuhan on 9 February and one is linked to a previous case.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

3      Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was
made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.
a)      Cases 8 and 9, as well as Cases 31, 33 and 38, are linked to The
Life Church and Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road). This is a
possible cluster involving five cases (Cases 8, 9, 31, 33 and 38).
b)      Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28,
34 and 40) are linked to the cluster associated with Yong Thai Hang (24
Cavan Road).
c)      Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to
the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22
January.
d)      Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are
linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.
e)      Eighteen of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57,
58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73 and 74) are linked to the
Grace Assembly of God.
4       Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the
clusters, our investigations have identified the following links between
cases:

-   Case 44 was a contact of Cases 13 and 26;
-   Case 77 is linked to Case 50, and Case 50 is linked to 55 and 65;
-   Case 72 is linked to Case 59; and
-   Case 75 is linked to Case 41.

5      Contact tracing is underway for the other seven locally
transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel
history to mainland China.

ABOUT THE CONFIRMED CASES

Case 76

6      Case 76 is a 1 year-old male Singapore Citizen who was among the
group of Singaporeans who were evacuated from Wuhan on 9 February. He
was without symptoms when he boarded the flight and was put under
quarantine upon landing in Singapore. He is currently warded in an
isolation room at the KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH).
7      All Singaporeans evacuated from Wuhan were tested for COVID-19 as
an added precaution. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 16
February afternoon.

Case 77

8     Case 77 is a 35 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent
travel history to China. He is a contact of Case 50. He was confirmed to
have COVID-19 infection on 17 February morning and is currently warded
in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

9      To date, a total of 24 cases have fully recovered from the
infection and have been discharged from hospital. Of the 53 confirmed
cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving. Four are
in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

UPDATE ON SUSPECT CASES

10      As of 17 February 2020, 12pm, 937 of the suspect cases have
tested negative for COVID-19, and 77 have tested positive. Test results
for the remaining 103 cases are pending.

UPDATE ON CONTACT TRACING FOR CONFIRMED CASES

11      Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once
identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a
precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their
last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts
who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.
12      As of 17 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 2,358 close
contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 1,081 are currently
quarantined, and 1,277 have completed their quarantine.
HEALTH ADVISORY

13     Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province
and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.
14      All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks
upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they
feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.
15      Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following
precautions at all times:

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating,

    after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory
    secretions after coughing or sneezing);

-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

16      MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical
practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely
to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
