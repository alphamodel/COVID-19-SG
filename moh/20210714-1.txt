COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE TESTING AND CLOSURE OF AFFECTED PREMISES
5.     MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst social
hostesses who had frequented KTV lounges or clubs currently operating as
F&B outlets, and their close social contacts. Our epidemiological
investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission at
the following premises:
i) One Exclusive (114 Middle Road);
ii) Level 9 (L9) (114 Middle Road);
iii) Terminal 10 (Clarke Quay); and
iv) Club M (114 Middle Road).
6.     To break any potential chain of transmission and enable deep
cleaning, these premises have been closed to all members of the public
from 15 July 2021 to 29 July 2021.
7.     We will also extend free COVID-19 testing to members of the
public who had:

i) Visited the following premises between 29 June and 14 July 2021:
- One Exclusive (114 Middle Road), Level 9 (L9) (114 Middle Road),
Terminal 10 (Clarke Quay) or Club M (114 Middle Road); or
- Similar KTV lounges or clubs operating as F&B outlets.
ii) Interacted with social hostesses of any nationality in any setting
between 29 June and 14 July 2021.
Please refer to https://go.gov.sg/ktv-testing for details on the testing
operations.

8.     All visitors to these premises and similar settings and those who
had interacted with social hostesses of any nationality are advised to
monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as
possible, for 14 days from their date of visit or interaction. They are
encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.
CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

9.     125 cases are currently warded in hospital. Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 8 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 1 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU).

10.     There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 18 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 14 are unvaccinated, 4 are partially vaccinated and none was fully
vaccinated.
