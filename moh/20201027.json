Case 58148 is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Vietnam under an Air Travel Pass. She is a caregiver to her sibling who was already receiving medical treatment in Singapore for an unrelated condition. She underwent a COVID-19 test upon arrival in Singapore on 10 October and her result came back negative. She subsequently developed acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms on 23 October and was tested for COVID-19 under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with ARI at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.<br></p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br></p><p>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.<br></p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imported cases: 6</strong><br></p><p>Amongst the 6 imported cases, 4 are currently employed in Singapore. Of these, 2 (Cases 58147 and 58149) are Work Pass holders who arrived from Japan and France, and 2 (Cases 58150 and 58151) are Work Permit holders who arrived from Indonesia. Another case (Case 58152) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from the UK. The remaining case (Case 58153) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who was allowed entry into Singapore to visit her child who is a Singapore Permanent Resident. They had all been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.<br></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1603897291618000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFO4VR2KXPy18YXmKbKTXTZ40EENw\" title=\"\" class=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/<wbr>situation-report</a>).<br></p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br></p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the clusters at CDPL Tuas Dormitory (6 Tuas South Street 15) and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory 1 (58 Penjuru Place) for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Links between previous cases found</strong></p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

Given the surveillance regime that we have put in place for travellers serving Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at their own residence, we will also adopt a risk-based approach and allow more travellers to serve their 14-day SHN at a suitable place of residence. From 1 January 2021, all incoming travellers will also be required to pay for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, and will be responsible for their inpatient medical bills if they have onset of symptoms of COVID-19 within 14 days of their entry to Singapore.<br><br><strong>More Travellers Allowed to Serve 14-Day SHN at Suitable Place of Residence<br></strong><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Currently, except for countries that we have unilaterally opened up to, travellers from selected low risk countries/ regions serve a 7-day SHN at their place of residence or suitable accommodation of their choice, and all other travellers serve a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since 11 August 2020, all travellers serving SHN outside of dedicated SHN facilities are required to don an electronic monitoring device throughout their SHN. This complements agencies\u2019 checks to ensure compliance with the SHN. With the enhanced surveillance regime in place, we will also adopt a risk-based approach and allow more <strong>travellers from Estonia, Fiji, Finland, Japan, Norway, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey<sup>[1]</sup> to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence,</strong> if they fulfil the following criteria:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Travelled to no other country than above-mentioned countries, in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Travellers from the abovementioned countries may apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities from <strong>2 November 2020</strong>, for arrivals on or after 4 November 2020. For Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs), the application must be made prior to arrival via the <a href=\"https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">Safe Travel Office website</a>. Travellers who are not SCs or PRs may apply to opt out as part of the entry approval process. All travellers must present the approval to opt out upon arrival in Singapore. As the list of countries will be updated from time to time depending on the public health risk assessment, <strong>all travellers must be prepared to be subject to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including stay in dedicated SHN facilities and payment, where applicable.</strong><br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All travellers who opt to stay at their place of residence for SHN must remain in their declared place of residence at all times. They will be subject to close monitoring of their whereabouts, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks. Strict enforcement action will be taken against those who breach the requirements of the SHN or make false declarations. Such persons will also be required to utilise specially designated transport services from the checkpoint to their place of residence and to their respective testing facilities, and bear the costs<sup>[2]</sup> for these transport arrangements.<br><br><strong>All Travellers to Bear Costs of Stay at Dedicated SHN Facilities and COVID-19 Treatment</strong><br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Government has thus far borne the costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities and medical bills for COVID-19 treatment for SCs and PRs who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020. The Government has also borne the costs of COVID-19 medical bills for new SCs/ PRs/ Long-Term Pass Holders (LTPHs), and existing LTPHs who departed Singapore before 27 March 2020. All other incoming travellers have had to pay for these costs as part of their private expenses, subject to the applicable healthcare arrangements for their bills<sup>[3]</sup>.<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stay in self-isolation facilities is now a widely-accepted requirement of international travel in a COVID-19 world. The vast majority of SCs and PRs who last left Singapore within the past year have returned. Hence with effect from <strong>1 January 2021</strong>, we will no longer waive the costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities for SCs and PRs who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020.<br><br>&nbsp;8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Similarly, with effect from <strong>1 January 2021</strong>, all returning SC/ PR/ LTPH travellers who last left Singapore before 27 March 2020, as well as new SCs/ PRs/ LTPHs will also be responsible for their inpatient medical bills, should they develop onset of symptoms within 14 days of their arrival in Singapore, but they will be able to tap on regular healthcare financial arrangements for their inpatient medical bills \u2013 SCs and PRs may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life / Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills, while LTPHs may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as private insurance.<br><br><strong>Regular Review of Border Measures</strong><br><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Singapore\u2019s border measures will evolve as the global situation changes. We will continue to monitor the global health situation closely and update our border measures in accordance with the public health risk assessment.
