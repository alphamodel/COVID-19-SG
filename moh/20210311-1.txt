2.      Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased
from 3 cases in the week before to 2 cases in the past week. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has remained stable at 2 cases per
week in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these
numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance
programme.
3.      Amongst the 72 confirmed cases reported from 5 March to 11
March, 35 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 28 have
tested negative, and 9 serology test results are pending.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 60818 is a 37 year-old female Indonesian national who is a foreign
domestic worker. She arrived in Singapore on 20 January 2021 and served
SHN at a dedicated facility until 3 February. Her swab done on 2
February during SHN was negative for COVID-19. Her COVID-19
pre-departure test taken in Indonesia on 18 January was also negative.
She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she was tested on 9 March as
part of MOH’s investigation into Case 60666¹. As an added precaution,
MOH tested all attendees of the Settling in Programme for foreign
domestic workers on 4 February, which both Cases 60666 and 60818
attended, even though they were not close contacts. Her test result came
back positive for COVID-19 infection on 9 March, and she was conveyed in
an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Her
serological test result has come back positive, which indicates a likely
past infection. However as we are unable to definitively confirm her
date of infection, we will take all the necessary public health actions
as a precautionary measure.
Based on our epidemiological investigations, Cases 60666 and 60818 are
likely to have been separately infected earlier and there is currently
no evidence that the 2 cases are linked.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 7
Amongst the 7 imported cases,
• 1 (Case 60807) is a Singaporean who returned from Qatar.
• 1 (Case 60803) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from India.
• 1 (Case 60816) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
India.
• 4 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and
Malaysia.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
4.      Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.      Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.      28 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,939 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.      There are currently 21 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 81 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
[1] Case 60666 is a 35 year-old female Indonesian national who is a
foreign domestic worker. She tested positive for COVID-19 infection on 4
March, but an additional test taken by the National Public Health
Laboratory on 5 March came back negative. Her serological test result
was positive, which indicates a likely past infection.
