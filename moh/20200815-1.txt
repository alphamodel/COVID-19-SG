472 MORE CASES DISCHARGED; 81 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 15 Aug 2020

      As of 15 August 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 81 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
a) IMPORTED CASES: 16 (2 Work Pass holders, 1 Work Permit holder, 3
Dependant’s Pass holders, 10 Special Pass holders)
Amongst the 16 imported cases, 3 (Cases 55671, 55695 and 55696) are
Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from India on 31 July and South
Africa on 29 July. Another 3 cases (Cases 55686, 55688 and 55690) are
Work Pass/ Work Permit holders who are currently employed in Singapore.
They arrived from Bangladesh on 1 August and the Philippines on 2
August. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN)
upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated
facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.
Another 10 cases are seamen who are Special Pass holders. They arrived
in Singapore from India on 8 August on a vessel, where they had not
disembarked from. As they had been identified as close contacts of
previous cases, they were swabbed while on the vessel even though 5 of
them are asymptomatic. They had remained on the vessel until their test
results came back positive for COVID-19, and subsequently conveyed in
ambulances to a hospital.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3 (2 SINGAPOREANS, 1 WORK PASS HOLDER)
All 3 cases in the community are linked to previous cases. 2 (Cases
55706 and 55731) had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed
cases. They had been placed on quarantine earlier, and were tested
during quarantine to determine their status. Case 55731 is a technician
who had boarded the affected vessel between 8 August and 12 August to
carry out essential repair and maintenance work. He was subsequently
placed on quarantine when some crew members were confirmed to have
COVID-19, and swabbed even though he is asymptomatic.
Case 55712 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to
identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further
spread.
Epidemiological investigations found that 3 cases (Cases 55169, 55469
and 55712) had visited Jewel Music Box KTV at HomeTeamNS Khatib on 1
August and 2 August 2020. Amongst them, 2 had been at the KTV for long
periods for work purposes. Visitors were invited to preview the new, yet
to be opened KTV premise on 1 August and 2 August, and most stayed for a
short period of time. The KTV was not operational during the visits and
there were no singing activities held. Therefore the risk of infection
for visitors is assessed to be low. However as a precautionary measure,
MOH will be contacting all visitors to the KTV on these two days and
facilitating COVID-19 testing for them. Those who are unwell when
contacted will be conveyed to the hospital for further medical
assessment. We advise all visitors to the Jewel Music Box KTV at
HomeTeamNS Khatib during the affected dates to monitor their health and
seek medical attention promptly should they develop acute respiratory
infection symptoms. They may call MOH at 1800-333-9999 if they have
queries.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average
of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C)      CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 62
The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in
the dormitories. There are currently about 20,700 workers who are still
serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when
their quarantine ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in
the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     All the new cases are linked to known clusters.
4.      The following dormitories have been cleared by the Inter-agency
Taskforce, and now house only recovered individuals and those who have
recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As such, the clusters
have now been closed.

-   36 & 38 Kian Teck Drive
-   17 Shaw Road
-   52 Tech Park Crescent
-   8 Tuas South Lane

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     472 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 51,521 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 83 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive
care unit. 4,030 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.
These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still
test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due
to COVID-19 infection.
