CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2
There are 2 cases in the community today, both of whom are linked to
previous cases.
_Case 59393_
Case 59393 is a 43 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case
59365¹, and a homemaker. She developed a runny nose on 10 January, and
subsequently loss of taste, sore throat and diarrhoea on 12 January, but
had not sought medical treatment.
As part of our contact tracing efforts, she was contacted by MOH on 16
January following the confirmation of Case 59365, and was tested for
COVID-19 when she reported these symptoms. Her test result came back
positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and she was conveyed to KK
Women’s and Children’s Hospital in an ambulance. Her serological test
result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current
infection.
_Case 59395_
Case 59395 is a 66 year-old female Malaysian national who is a Long-Term
Visit Pass holder, and has been residing in Singapore since January
2020. She is a retiree who is a family member of Case 59365. She
developed acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and diarrhoea on 9
January, and subsequently loss of taste on 14 January, but had not
sought medical treatment.
As she had been identified as a close contact of Case 59365, she was
contacted by MOH on 16 January and tested for COVID-19 when she reported
these symptoms. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19
infection the next day, and she was conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital
in an ambulance. Her serological test result has come back positive.
Together with her COVID-19 symptoms, this indicates a likely recent
infection with onset on 9 January.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members,
have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the
start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close
contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.
We strongly urge everyone to do their part to reduce the risk of
transmission. Those who are unwell, including those showing early/mild
symptoms, should be socially responsible and seek medical attention
immediately.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 12
Amongst the 12 imported cases,
- 2 (Cases 59394 and 59400) are Singaporeans and 4 (Cases 59388, 59389,
59397 and 59399) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from
India, Mexico, Pakistan, Switzerland, UK and US.
- 1 (Case 59398) is a Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from India.
- 1 (Case 59392) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from Czech
