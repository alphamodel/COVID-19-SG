    <body><h1>418 More Cases Discharged; 188 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 02 Jul 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 2 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 188 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:<br><strong><br>&nbsp; a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Imported cases: 1 </strong>(1 Work Pass holder)<br><br>There is an imported case today involving a Filipino national who had returned to Singapore from the United Kingdom on 20 June 2020. She is a Work Pass holder who is currently employed in Singapore. She was placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore, and had been conveyed in a dedicated transport to an SHN facility to commence her 14-day isolation. She is asymptomatic, and had been tested while serving SHN.<br><strong><br>&nbsp; b)&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases in the community: 10 </strong>(8 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents, 2 Work Permit holders)<br><br>Of the 10 cases in the community, 3 had been picked up as a result of our proactive surveillance and screening, and 5 had already been placed on quarantine earlier.<br><br>Amongst the 8 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents cases, 3 (Cases 44193, 44256 and 44299) had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases and had already been quarantined earlier. Another 3 cases (Cases 44261, 44262 and 44263) were detected due to our proactive surveillance of persons working at dormitories, or those deployed to frontline COVID-19 operations, even though they are asymptomatic. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining 2 cases (Cases 44167 and 44199)&nbsp; who had been swabbed under our enhanced community testing after being diagnosed with acute respiratory infection.<br><br>Both Work Permit holders (Cases 44258 and 44298) had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had already been quarantined earlier. They were tested during quarantine to verify their status.<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections.<sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;The serological test result for Cases 44261 and 44262 have come back positive, which indicate likely past infections. The test results for the remaining cases are pending.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 9 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 4 per day in the past week.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><strong><br>&nbsp; c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases residing in dormitories: 177<br><br></strong>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOHâ€™s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).
