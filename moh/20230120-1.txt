Over 850 General Practitioner Clinics Open During Chinese New Year



OVER 850 GENERAL PRACTITIONER CLINICS OPEN DURING CHINESE NEW YEAR


Published Date: 20 Jan 2023

      853 general practitioner (GP) clinics will be open at various
times during the Chinese New Year public holidays from 21 January to 24
January 2023. Amongst these, 592 selected Public Health Preparedness
Clinics (PHPCs) will be available to provide COVID-19 swabs.

2.     The public may access the latest list of GP clinics and their
operating hours through:

-   The Ministry of Health’s (MOH) corporate website;
-   The Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC) website;
-   Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) webpage; and
-   flu.gowhere.gov.sg for the list of PHPCs.

3.     All 10 Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) across the
island will operate from 9.00am to 1.00pm on 21 January. The JTVCs will
be closed from 22 January to 24 January.

4.     We encourage members of the public, including children, who feel
unwell during the festive period to visit their GP or a 24-hour clinic
for minor conditions. Those who develop symptoms of acute respiratory
infection (such as cough, sore throat and runny nose) as well as fever
and loss of taste or smell, are strongly encouraged to wear a mask and
refrain from visiting. Symptomatic individuals are encouraged to visit a
PHPC if consultation is required.

5.     Members of the public should first call the clinics to confirm
the availability and timing of services, particularly for COVID-19
testing and vaccinations, and make appointments as needed before heading
to the clinics.

6.     Individuals cared for by telemedicine providers, such as those on
the Home Recovery Programme, will continue to have access to these
services.

7.     We advise the public to seek medical treatment at a hospital’s
Accident & Emergency (A&E) department only for serious or
life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness, and
uncontrollable bleeding. To ensure that the 995 Emergency Medical
Services is able to provide swift conveyance for those with emergency
conditions, we advise individuals who are not experiencing
life-threatening emergencies to refrain from calling 995.

8.     We seek everyone’s continued effort and cooperation to exercise
social responsibility. Test yourself regularly and follow the prevailing
health protocols (www.covid.gov.sg) if you test positive.

9.     MOH wishes everyone a happy Chinese New Year and a healthy year
ahead. We would also like to take this opportunity to remind the public
to eat in moderation and continue exercising regularly to stay healthy
over the holiday period.
