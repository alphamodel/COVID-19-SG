• 13 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India,
Indonesia and Myanmar, of whom 6 (Cases 59821, 59823, 59827, 59828,
59841 and 59842) are foreign domestic workers.
• 5 (Cases 59834, 59835, 59836, 59838 and 59840) are Short-Term Visit
Pass holders. Case 59834 arrived from India to study in Singapore. Cases
59835, 59836 and 59838 arrived from India, Myanmar and Indonesia
respectively to visit their family members who are Singaporeans or
Singapore Permanent Residents. Case 59840 arrived from the Philippines
for her upcoming marriage to her Singaporean fiancé.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
Case 59825 is a 36 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who
returned from a trip to India on 19 December 2020 and served SHN at a
dedicated facility until 2 January 2021. His swab done on 31 December
during SHN was negative for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was
detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 29 January in
preparation for another trip to India. His test result came back
positive the next day, and he was conveyed to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases. His Ct value was very high, which is indicative of
a low viral load, and his serology test result has also come back
positive. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we have
classified the case as imported based on his travel history. He is
likely to be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no
longer transmissible and infective to others.
