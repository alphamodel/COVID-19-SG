The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 5 </strong>(1 Singaporean, 1 Work Pass holder, 1 Student\u2019s Pass holder, 1 Long-Term Visit Pass holder, 1 Short-Term Visit Pass holder)<br><br>Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 46809) is a Singaporean who returned from India on 3 July. Another 2 cases (Cases 46744 and 46795) are Work Pass or Student\u2019s Pass holders who are currently employed or study in Singapore.&nbsp; Another case (Case 46743) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder whose spouse is a Singapore Permanent Resident. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN.<br><br>The remaining case (Case 46802) had been conveyed in a dedicated transport from Changi Airport to a vessel at Jurong Port upon arrival in Singapore, where he had remained until he was placed on quarantine at a government quarantine facility.<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 15 <sup></sup></strong><sup><span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">[1]</span></sup><strong><sup></sup>&nbsp;</strong>(3 Work Pass holders, 12 Work Permit holders)<br><br>Of the 15 cases in the community, 11 were picked up as a result of our proactive surveillance and screening, and 3 had already been placed on quarantine earlier. 14 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected through our proactive testing.&nbsp;<br><br>5 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or clusters. Of these, 3 cases (Cases 46766, 46942 and 46943) had been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been tested during their quarantine to determine their status, even though they are asymptomatic. The remaining 2 cases (Cases 46807 and 46812) are also asymptomatic, and were swabbed as part of our periodic screening of workers in the construction sector.&nbsp;<br><br>10 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 9 cases had been detected as a result of our screening of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining case (Case 46730), who was swabbed under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to detect infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.&nbsp;<br><br>Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to determine if these cases could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 14 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 13 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased, from an average of 6 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 8 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 229</strong><br><br>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

The dormitory at 11 Tuas Avenue 10 has been cleared, and now houses only recovered individuals and those who have recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As such, the cluster has now been closed.<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the past week (8 July to 14 July), MOH has uncovered links for 11 previously unlinked cases.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
