A) IMPORTED CASES: 15 (3 Singaporeans, 2 Permanent Residents, 2 Work
Pass holders, 1 Work Permit holder, 2 Student’s Pass holders, 1
Short-Term Visit Pass holder, 4 Special Pass holders)
Amongst the 15 imported cases, 3 (Cases 57914, 57926 and 57927) are
Singaporeans and 2 (Cases 57920 and 57928) are Singapore Permanent
Residents who returned to Singapore from Indonesia on 19 September and
India on 17 September and 19 September. 3 (Cases 57929, 57930 and 57931)
are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who
arrived from France on 20 September, the Philippines on 18 September and
India on 19 September. 2 (Cases 57912 and 57913) are Student’s Pass
holders who arrived from India on 19 September. Another case (Case
57921) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from India on 28
September. He was allowed entry into Singapore as he was already
receiving medical care in Singapore and had returned for further
treatment.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.
The remaining 4 (Cases 57922, 57923, 57924 and 57925) are Special Pass
holders who are crew members of a ship. They arrived in Singapore from
Malaysia on 23 September and had not disembarked from the ship. They
subsequently reported symptoms and were swabbed while on the ship, where
they had remained until their test results came back positive for
COVID-19. They were then conveyed in ambulances to a hospital.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1 [1] (1 Permanent Resident)
There is 1 case in the community today who is linked to previous cases.
Case 57915 had been identified as a contact of previously confirmed
cases, and had been placed on quarantine earlier. He was tested during
quarantine to determine his status, even though he is asymptomatic.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an
average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 3
Amongst the 3 cases residing in dormitories, 1 had been identified
earlier as a contact of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. He was tested during quarantine to
determine his status.
The remaining 2 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
2.    Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.         Of the new cases, 95% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
4.        MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to 8 Sungei Kadut
Loop for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has
now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.       Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.      24 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,512 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.         There are currently 44 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 201 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.

been removed following investigation. The initial test results for Cases
57918 and 57919 had been borderline-positive and further tests have

health actions had been taken earlier and neither the cases nor their
contacts had been exposed to risk of infection due to the initial
