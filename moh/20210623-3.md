    <body><h1>Update On Vaccine Category Name</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 23 Jun 2021</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine currently used in our national vaccination programme is manufactured at various sites across Europe and labelled according to the regulatory approval in various markets.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we accelerate our vaccine supplies, we will be receiving a batch of vaccines called “Comirnaty<sup>TM</sup>”. These vaccines are the same as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that we have been using in our national vaccination programme, with the same research name BNT162b2. They are manufactured according to the same processes and procedures, and meet the same finished product specifications as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. They are similarly manufactured in Europe and shipped directly to Singapore. The only difference is in their label.<br></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Health will be adjusting the HealthHub records of individuals who have received or will be receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech or Comirnaty<sup>TM</sup> vaccine to administratively reflect the vaccine received under a category called “Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty”.<br></p><p><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>23 JUNE 2021</strong></p></body>
