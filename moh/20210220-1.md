As there have been no more cases linked to the Case 59429 cluster for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases<br></strong><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;22 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
