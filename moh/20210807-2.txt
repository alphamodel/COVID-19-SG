Published Date: 07 Aug 2021

        The Ministry of Health (MOH) monitors the local situation
closely and ringfences infected cases in the community through contact
tracing, testing and quarantine. Since the last community surveillance
testing conducted at 556 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 on 1 August 2021, there
have been new cases of COVID-19 infection in the block.



2.     In order to detect cases who were still incubating the virus in
the first round of testing and to prevent spread in the community, MOH
will conduct mandatory COVID-19 testing for all residents of 556 Ang Mo
Kio Avenue 10. Testing is optional for those who have tested negative
for COVID-19 infection from 5 August onwards. Mandatory testing will be
conducted on 8 August 2021 between 9am and 12pm, and 1pm and 4pm, at the
Regional Screening Centre at 8 Ang Mo Kio Street 54 (former Da Qiao
Primary School).



3.     All residents are to bring along their NRIC for identification
purposes. Leaflets have been distributed and SMS notifications have been
sent to the residents to provide them with more information. Residents
are reminded to keep to their appointment time. Residents are also
advised to monitor their health closely and consult a doctor immediately
if they feel unwell. Those who are still awaiting their test results are
advised to minimise social interactions as much as possible. They should
continue to monitor their health and seek immediate medical attention if
they feel unwell.
