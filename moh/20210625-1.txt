COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCE TESTING AT ENG WATT STREET


Published Date: 25 Jun 2021

     The Ministry of Health (MOH) is investigating likely COVID-19
transmission at Eng Watt Street. So far, 13 cases [1] of COVID-19
infection have been detected in three households at 66 Eng Watt
Street. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine linkages
and the source of transmission.
2. In order to disrupt any wider, undetected community
transmission, MOH will conduct mandatory COVID-19 testing for all
residents of 66 Eng Watt Street. Testing is optional for those who have
tested negative for COVID-19 infection from 22 June onwards. In the
event that a positive COVID-19 case is detected, MOH will isolate the
case, identify all close contacts, test and quarantine them to protect
the community from further transmission. Mandatory testing will be
conducted at the pavilion at 2D Boon Tiong Road from 26 to 27 June 2021
between 9am and 4pm.
3. To detect possible asymptomatic cases in the community, MOH
will also conduct voluntary COVID-19 testing for visitors and those who
have interacted with residents of 66 Eng Watt Street between 8 June and
22 June 2021. We encourage these individuals to come forward for
testing. Testing will be conducted by appointment only at designated
Regional Screening Centres from 26 to 27 June 2021 between 9am and
4pm.To book an appointment and for information on the alternate test
locations, please visit https://go.gov.sg/66-ew-covid-19-testing, or
call 1800 333 9999 if you have any queries.
4.      All residents are to bring along their NRIC for identification
purposes. Leaflets have been distributed and SMS notifications have been
sent to the residents to provide them with more information. Residents
are also advised to monitor their health closely and consult a doctor
immediately if they feel unwell. Those who are still awaiting their test
results are advised to minimise social interactions as much as possible.
They should continue to monitor their health and seek immediate medical
attention if they feel unwell.
