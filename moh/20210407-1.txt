CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 61639 is a 40 year-old female Myanmar national who is a foreign
domestic worker. She arrived from Myanmar on 13 November 2020 and served
SHN at a dedicated facility. Her test taken on 23 November during SHN
was negative for COVID-19. While she was serving SHN, she had been
identified as a close contact of Case 58386 during their flight to
Singapore, and was placed on quarantine from 24 November to 27 November.
On 27 November, she started work at her employer’s residence.
She developed a headache on 2 April 2021 and shortness of breath on 4
April, and was tested for COVID-19 when she sought medical treatment on
4 April. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on
the same day and she was warded at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.
Another test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory on 5
April was negative for COVID-19 infection. Her serological test result
has come back positive, which is indicative of a past infection. She
could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer
transmissible and infective to others, but given that we are not able to
definitively conclude when she had been infected, we will take all the
necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 34
Amongst the 34 imported cases,
-   1 (Case 61666) is a Singaporean who returned from the UK.

Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, of whom 7 (Cases 61630, 61633,

Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.
4.     Please refer to the Annexesand MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     21 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,260 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 46 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 218 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
