medical treatment at a General Practitioner clinic but was diagnosed
with suspected dengue. He later developed acute respiratory infection

4. Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all
the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed
on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.

uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
