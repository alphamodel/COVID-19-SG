Published Date: 31 Dec 2020

      As of 31 December 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed 5 new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19
infection. Based on our investigations so far, the cases are in the
community, and there are no new cases in the dormitories. Of these, 2
are family members of Case 58810 [1], and 3 are a family cluster
involving a harbour pilot (Case 58817) who was detected from Rostered
Routine Testing (RRT).
2.   In addition, there are 25 imported cases, who had already been
placed on Stay-Home Notice or isolated upon arrival in Singapore.
Amongst them, 5 are Singaporeans or Singapore Permanent Residents, and 9
are foreign domestic workers. In total, there are 30 new cases of
COVID-19 infection in Singapore today.
3.   We are aggressively tracing and testing the close contacts of the
community cases so as to ringfence these cases and prevent further
transmission. In addition, MOH will commence a special testing
operations to test individuals who had boarded the ships that Cases
58810 and 58817 had recently worked on. We will also test harbour
pilots, marine surveyors and ship repair workers in the coming days,
regardless of their RRT schedule, to determine their COVID-19 status. In
view of the recent cases involving the marine sector, we will review the
need to tighten our precautionary measures for these workers.
4.   We are still working through the details of the cases, and further
updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued
tonight.
