CASE DETAILS
A)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 2
There are 2 cases residing in dormitories today, both of whom were
detected through surveillance testing. This allows us to pick up cases
early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence
them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively
containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.
C)  IMPORTED CASES: 5
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 1 (Case 58211) is a Dependant’s Pass
holder who arrived from the UAE. The remaining cases are currently
employed in Singapore. Of these, Case 58212 is a Work Pass holder who
arrived from Switzerland, and Cases 58213, 58214 and 58215 are Work
Permit holders who arrived from Indonesia and Myanmar. They had all
already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested
while serving SHN.
3.  Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
4.  Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.  1 more case of COVID-19 infection has been discharged from a
community isolation facility. In all, 57,938 have fully recovered from
the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care
facilities.
7.  There are currently 44 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 26 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
