ISSUANCE OF CORRECTION DIRECTION UNDER THE PROTECTION FROM ONLINE FALSEHOODS AND MANIPULATION ACT 2019 ON FALSEHOODS REGARDING PATIENT WHO ALLEGEDLY SUFFERED MISCARRIAGE AFTER FOUR HOUR WAIT AT KKH


Published Date: 27 Mar 2022

     The Ministry of Health (MOH) is aware that “Wake Up, Singapore”
(WUSG) had posted allegations across its website, Facebook, and
Instagram pages on 23 March 2022, which claimed that a COVID-positive
patient who was 20 weeks pregnant had suffered a miscarriage after
waiting four hours to see a doctor at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital
(KKH) A&E department in February 2022. These allegations are false.
2.  KKH had identified the patient in question based on a screenshot of
a hospital bill accompanying WUSG’s posts, which contained discrepancies
with the patient’s account of events. Subsequent investigations by KKH
have confirmed that the patient had been seen by a doctor within an hour
of her arrival at KKH in February 2022, and did not suffer any
miscarriage.
3.  On 25 March 2022, WUSG published further posts on its Facebook and
Instagram pages, stating that they have been informed by the patient
that her recollection was false, and that WUSG “may have been fed lies
at every turn”. WUSG has also apologised to KKH for publishing these
allegations.
4.  Notwithstanding WUSG’s apology, the allegations are serious and
have been circulated to various other platforms. This could lead to the
erosion of public trust in the credibility and professionalism of our
healthcare system and institutions. Accordingly, the Minister for Health
has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation
Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to “Wake Up,
Singapore” in respect of the falsehoods, to ensure that the public is
provided with the full facts. “Wake Up, Singapore” is required to
publish the correction notices as specified by the POFMA Office for each
webpage and social media post containing the falsehoods.
5.  The Government takes a serious view of these falsehoods, which
appear to have been fabricated. The matter has been referred to the
relevant authorities for investigation. KKH had also lodged a Police
Report on 25 March 2022.
6.  For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article
“Corrections regarding patient who allegedly suffered miscarriage after
four-hour wait at KKH” at https://www.gov.sg/article/factually260322.
7.  We urge the public not to spread unsubstantiated information, which
may cause public alarm.
