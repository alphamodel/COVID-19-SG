5.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.

transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to the Case 63892,
Chevy’s Bar and Bistro, and JEM/ Westgate clusters for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the clusters have now been closed.
