    <body><h1>347 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 14 Jul 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 14 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed an additional 347 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there are 7 cases in the community, of whom 1 is a Singaporean and 6 are Work Pass holders. In addition, there are 2 imported cases who had been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have to date tested and cleared more than 215,000 workers (or two-thirds of those living in dormitories). Work is ongoing to prepare these dormitories to be declared cleared, and for workers to resume work. We are on track to clear about 80% of workers staying in the dormitories by end-July, and to complete the testing of dormitory residents around mid-August.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few days, we have a larger population of migrant workers in various purpose-built dormitories completing their isolation period and being tested for COVID-19. As some of them came from dormitories with higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection, we can expect a higher number of confirmed cases in the next few days from this group of migrant workers.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;We are still working through the details of the cases today, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>14 JULY 2020</strong></p></body>
