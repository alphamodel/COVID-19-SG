NO NEW CASES OF LOCALLY TRANSMITTED COVID-19 INFECTION


Published Date: 20 Dec 2020

         As of 20 December 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed that there are no new cases of locally
transmitted COVID-19 infection.
2.     There are 19 imported cases, who had already been placed on
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore.
3.      We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
INVESTIGATIONS INTO 13 CASES WHO SERVED SHN AT MANDARIN ORCHARD
SINGAPORE
4.      MOH announced on 19 December that it is investigating 13 cases
[1] of COVID-19 infection amongst individuals who had served SHN at
Mandarin Orchard Singapore between 22 October and 11 November 2020. As a
precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all guests, the hotel has
stopped accepting new guests since 19 December and is checking out
existing guests progressively. Individuals serving SHN at Mandarin
Orchard Singapore have been transported via dedicated vehicles to an
alternative SHN dedicated facility.
5.      In total, 394 persons serving SNH at the hotel have been
swabbed, and 384 test results are ready, while 10 are pending. Of the
results that are ready, 381 have come back negative for COVID-19
infection. 3 have tested positive and were immediately conveyed to the
hospital via ambulance. As they have recent travel history, it is likely
that these are imported and have been included in todayâ€™s case count.
Nevertheless the National Public Health Laboratory will conduct whole
genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to determine if they could
be linked to the 13 cases. It takes about 4 weeks to culture the virus
and complete the genome sequencing.
6.      MOH has also tested 158 staff of Mandarin Orchard Singapore so
far, and all the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test results have come
back negative for COVID-19. However the serological tests of 3 staff
have come back positive, indicating likely past infections.
Epidemiological investigations of these cases are in progress.
