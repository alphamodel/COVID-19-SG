She arrived from India on 28 December 2020 and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 10 January 2021. Her test taken on 8 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19. As she had been identified as a close contact of Cases 59169 and 59173 during their flight to Singapore, she was placed on quarantine from 10 January to 11 January.<br></p><p>She developed a fever on 5 April and was tested for COVID-19 when she sought medical treatment the next day. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 8 April and she was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Another test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory on 9 April was negative for COVID-19 infection. Her serological test result has come back positive, which is indicative of a past infection. She could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude when she had been infected, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong></p><p>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imported cases: 31</strong></p><p>Amongst the 31 imported cases,<br></p><p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 (Case 61797) is a Singaporean who returned from Papua New Guinea.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 (Cases 61770 and 61782) are Dependant\u2019s Pass holders who arrived from India.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 (Cases 61785, 61796 and 61804) are Long-Term Visit Pass holders who arrived from India and Myanmar.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 (Cases 61772, 61773, 61774, 61775 and 61781) are Student's Pass holders who arrived from India.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 (Cases 61762, 61805 and 61806) are Work Pass holders who arrived from Nepal, the Maldives and Philippines.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines, of whom 5 (Cases 61758, 61789, 61790, 61800 and 61807) are foreign domestic workers.<br>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 (Cases 61769 and 61808) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders.
