3.    Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
4.      Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
INVESTIGATIONS INTO 13 CASES WHO SERVED SHN AT MANDARIN ORCHARD
SINGAPORE
5.      As announced this afternoon, MOH is investigating 13 cases¹ of
COVID-19 infection amongst individuals who had served SHN at Mandarin
Orchard Singapore between 22 October and 11 November 2020. The cases,
who were confirmed between 2 November and 11 November to have COVID-19
infection, were observed to have high genetic similarity despite having
arrived from different countries. From MOH’s preliminary investigations,
we cannot exclude that transmissions could have occurred at Mandarin
Orchard Singapore.
6.      As a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all guests,
the hotel has stopped accepting new guests and is checking out existing
guests progressively. Persons serving SHN will be transported via
dedicated vehicles to an alternative SHN dedicated facility. Deep
cleaning and disinfection will be carried out by the hotel, in
consultation with MOH and the National Environment Agency. MOH has
commenced a special testing operations to test around 500 staff of the
hotel for COVID-19 infection. We have also tested most of those who are
currently serving SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore, and are pending the
results of their tests.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
