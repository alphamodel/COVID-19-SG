Updates On Border Measures for Travellers From Australia and Guangdong
Province, Mainland China



UPDATES ON BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM AUSTRALIA AND GUANGDONG PROVINCE, MAINLAND CHINA


Published Date: 30 Jun 2021

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the global
COVID-19 situation. We will tighten our border measures for travellers
from Australia, given the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases
there.
2.      As the situation in Guangdong province, Mainland China has
improved, we will allow travellers from Guangdong province, Mainland
China to undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon
arrival, and to go about their activities in Singapore if the PCR test
result is negative.

TRAVELLERS FROM AUSTRALIA TO SERVE 7-DAY SHN AT PLACE OF RESIDENCE

3.     Given the increased cases observed in Australia, we will be
tightening border control measures for travellers with travel history to
Australia. From 2 JULY 2021, 2359 HOURS:

a) Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs) and Long-Term
Pass holders entering Singapore with travel history to Australia, within
the last 21 days before departure for Singapore, will be subject to an
on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, a 7-day SHN at their place of residence,
and a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of the SHN period.

b)  Short-term travellers holding an Air Travel Pass (ATP), with travel
history to Australia within the last 21 days before departure for
Singapore, will not be allowed to enter Singapore.

(excluding Guangdong province) in the last 21 days prior to travel will
continue to be subject to a COVID-19 test upon arrival at the airport,

border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to
the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the
SafeTravel website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check
for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be
prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry.
