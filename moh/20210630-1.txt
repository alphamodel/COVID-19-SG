CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
5.     133 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 8 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 4 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU).

6.     There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 24 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 20 are unvaccinated, 3 are partially vaccinated and 1 is fully
vaccinated (patient was already ill before infection).
