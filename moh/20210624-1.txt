Updates On Border Measures for Travellers From New South Wales and
Victoria State, Australia



UPDATES ON BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM NEW SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA STATE, AUSTRALIA


Published Date: 24 Jun 2021

          The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the
global COVID-19 situation. We will tighten our border measures for
travellers from New South Wales, Australia, given the increase in the
number of COVID-19 cases there. As the situation in Victoria State,
Australia has improved, we will allow travellers from Victoria State,
Australia to undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
upon arrival, and to go about their activities in Singapore if the PCR
test result is negative.

2.  We had earlier announced that travellers from Australia
(excluding Victoria State) would be allowed to undergo a COVID-19 PCR
test upon arrival, and if the PCR test result is negative, they will be
allowed to go about their activities in Singapore, without a need to
serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN).



TRAVELLERS FROM NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA TO SERVE 7-DAY SHN AT PLACE

          a.  Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs)
and Long-Term Pass holders entering Singapore with travel history to New
South Wales, Australia, within the last 21 days before departure for

SHN at their place of residence, and a COVID-19 PCR test before the end
of the SHN period.

          b.  Short-term travellers holding an Air Travel Pass
(ATP) with travel history to New South Wales, Australia, within the last
21 days before departure for Singapore, will not be allowed to enter

our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission
to the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the
