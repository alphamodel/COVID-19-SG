    <body><h1>Novavax Nuvaxovid Covid-19 Vaccine Authorised for Use In National Vaccination Programme</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 14 Feb 2022</p> <span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has accepted the recommendation of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination to include the Nuvaxovid COVID-19 vaccine (Nuvaxovid) by Novavax in the National Vaccination Programme for use in individuals aged 18 years and above, for both COVID-19 primary and booster vaccination. This follows the Health Sciences Authority's (HSA) interim authorisation of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; The first batch of the Nuvaxovid vaccine is expected to arrive in Singapore in the next few months if there are no disruptions to the shipment schedule. We will roll out the Nuvaxovid vaccine for individuals aged 18 years and above when shipments of the vaccine arrive. More details will be shared later.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the meantime, we encourage those who are medically eligible not to delay their vaccinations and boosters, and to take the mRNA vaccines available in our National Vaccination Programme as this will provide timely and effective protection against COVID-19.<br><br><strong><br>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>14 FEBRUARY 2022</strong></span></span></body>
