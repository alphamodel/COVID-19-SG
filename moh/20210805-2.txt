Updates On Border Measures for Travellers From Taiwan



UPDATES ON BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM TAIWAN


Published Date: 05 Aug 2021

     The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the global
COVID-19 situation. As the situation in Taiwan has improved, we will
allow travellers from Taiwan to undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) test upon arrival, and to go about their activities in
Singapore if the PCR test result is negative.

UPDATED BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM TAIWAN

2.   We had earlier announced that travellers from Taiwan will be
subjected to an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, a 14-day Stay-Home Notice
(SHN) at a dedicated SHN facility (or opt out to serve at their place of
residence), and a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of the SHN period.

3.    As the situation in Taiwan has improved:

a.    From 7 AUGUST 2021, 2359 HOURS, all travellers entering Singapore
with travel history to Taiwan, within the last 21 days before departure
for Singapore, will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival [1], and
will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore if the PCR
test result is negative. They will not need to serve a 14-day SHN
period.
b.    Short-term visitors with travel history to Taiwan, within the last
21 days before departure for Singapore, can apply for an Air Travel Pass
with immediate effect, for entry into Singapore on or after 12 AUGUST
2021. They will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival, and will be
allowed to go about their activities in Singapore if the PCR test result
is negative.

c.     Travellers who are already serving their 14-day SHN at their
place of residence as of 7 August 2021, 2359 hours will still be
required to complete their 14-day SHN and exit swab.

REGULAR REVIEW OF BORDER MEASURES
4.      As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our
border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to
the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on
the SafeTravel website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to
check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and
be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon
entry.
