Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study Findings



GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE 2019 STUDY FINDINGS


Published Date: 28 Oct 2020

1. Based on the findings of the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study¹
(GBD 2019), Singapore was ranked first globally for life expectancy (LE)
at birth and healthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth, with the lowest
Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per 100,000 population in the
world.
2. The GBD study quantifies the magnitude of ill health and premature
deaths due to diseases, injuries and risk factors across countries and
through time. GBD 2019 provides updated results based on latest data
sources, refined methodologies and feedback from GBD 2017². The study is
an international collaboration led by the Institute for Health Metrics
and Evaluation and the World Health Organization and incorporates inputs
from public health researchers and government policy makers from many
countries, including the Ministry of Health in Singapore.
LIFE EXPECTANCY AND HEALTHY LIFE EXPECTANCY
3. Overall, the global LE and HALE at birth have increased from 1990 to
2019, from 65.4 years in 1990 to 73.5 years in 2019 for LE, and 56.9
years in 1990 to 63.5 years in 2019 for HALE.
4. Singapore has the highest LE at birth (84.9 years) among countries in
the world in 2019. Overall, this is an increase from 1990 (75.6 years),
when Singapore was ranked 26th in the world.
3. Based on GBD 2019’s findings, Singapore’s HALE at birth is the
highest in the world at 73.9 years in 2019. Overall, this is an increase
from 1990 (66.6 years), when Singapore was ranked 16th in the world.
HALE is the average number of years that a person is expected to live in
good health by taking into account years lived in ill health due to
disease and/ or injury. Table 1 below shows the comparison of LE and
HALE for the top five countries.

DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS AND ATTRIBUTABLE RISK FACTORS
4. According to the GBD 2019 findings, Singapore has the lowest
age-standardised DALY burden, in line with the improvement in
Singapore’s HALE at birth. Singapore’s age-standardised DALY rate in
2019 was 15,045 per 100,000 population, a decrease from 25,491 DALYs per
100,000 population in 1990. Disease burden in terms of DALYs is a
summary measure of the years of healthy life lost due to premature
mortality and ill health experienced by a population. Table 2 shows the
comparison for DALYs for the top five countries.

5. Non-communicable diseases made up approximately 80% of the total
disease burden in Singapore in 2019. In decreasing order of DALY burden,
the top five leading causes of mortality and ill health were cancers
(15.5%), musculoskeletal disorders (14.4%), cardiovascular diseases
(13.9%), mental disorders (8.3%) and other non-communicable diseases
(6.7%) such as urinary diseases or congenital birth defects. Diabetes
and chronic kidney disease also ranked among the top 10.
6. The GBD 2019 also found that approximately 35% of the DALY burden in
Singapore can potentially be reduced by early intervention on modifiable
risk factors. These modifiable risk factors include smoking, poor diet,
low physical activity, high blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose
level, high body-mass index and high low-density lipoprotein
(cholesterol) level.
7. The Ministry of Health will continue to work with partners and
stakeholders to further strengthen our existing initiatives and develop
health interventions that can further reduce disease burden. Over time,
we hope that the efforts to prevent diseases and to delay or mitigate
their complications will lead to continued improvements in health.

studies, producing estimates for 286 causes of death, 369 diseases and
injuries and 87 risk factors in 204 countries and territories.

to differences in methodologies, datasets and assumptions.
