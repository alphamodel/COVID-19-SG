CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3
There are 3 cases in the community today, who are currently unlinked.
Case 59757
Case 59757 is a 72 year-old male Singaporean who is employed by Certis
Cisco as an aviation screening officer at Changi Airport Terminal 1. His
job entails screening baggage of arrival passengers via X-ray scanners,
and directing passengers to the baggage screening lanes.
He developed a cough and sore throat on 25 January but did not seek
medical treatment. On 27 January, he went to work and was tested as part
of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back
positive for COVID-19 on 28 January night, and an individual test was
done later that night at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases
(NCID). His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the
next day. His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 15 January –
were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come
back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.
It was revealed that on 28 January, Case 59757 met with 12 other
individuals for tennis at the National Service Resort & Country Club (10
Changi Coast Walk). Investigations are ongoing to assess if there had
been any breach of the relevant prevailing safe management measures.
Case 59757 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine on 25 January at the vaccination centre located at Changi
Airport Terminal 4. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could
not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be
infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a
few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing
vaccination.
Case 59788
Case 59788 is a 68 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who works
as a cleaner at Broadway Coffee Shop (848 Yishun Street 81).
He developed a sore throat and body aches on 26 January but did not seek
medical treatment. He went to work on 27 January, and developed a runny
nose that night. He stayed at home the next day. On 29 January, he
sought medical treatment at a polyclinic where he was tested for
COVID-19 as part of our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection at first presentation to a doctor.
He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on the same day, and was
subsequently conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. His serology test result
is pending.
Case 59789
Case 59789 is a 69 year-old female Singapore Permanent Resident who is
the spouse of Case 59788. She is a homemaker.
She developed a cough and flu on 23 January and but did not seek medical
treatment until 29 January when she went to a polyclinic with her
husband who was also symptomatic. She was tested for COVID-19 and her
result came back positive on the same day. She was subsequently conveyed
in an ambulance to NCID. Her serology test result is pending.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them.
We strongly urge everyone to do their part to reduce the risk of
transmission. Those who are unwell, including those showing early/mild
symptoms, should be socially responsible and seek medical attention
immediately and stay at home to prevent the spread of illness to others.
