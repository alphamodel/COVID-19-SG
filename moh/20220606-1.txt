MOH STATEMENT ON ONE CONFIRMED MONKEYPOX CASE INVOLVING A TRANSIT TRAVELLER


Published Date: 06 Jun 2022

The Ministry of Health (MOH) was informed on 4 June 2022, by the New
South Wales Ministry of Health, of one confirmed case of monkeypox who
had transited through Singapore to Australia on 2 June.

The traveller arrived in Sydney on 3 June and had tested positive for
monkeypox there. He had departed from Barcelona on 1 June and arrived at
Changi Airport on 2 June. He had remained in the transit holding area at
Changi Airport until his departure for Sydney on the same day, and did
not visit other areas in Changi Airport.

As the case did not enter Singapore or interact with persons in the
community, there is currently no significant risk of community
transmission. However, as a precautionary measure, we have conducted
contact tracing for the two affected flights and those who might have
come into contact with the traveller at the airport transit area.

There were no assessed close contacts, and hence no requirement for
quarantine. However, we have put 13 persons who may have casual contact
with the traveller on phone surveillance for 21 days. Persons under
phone surveillance will receive daily phone calls to ascertain their
health status until the end of the monitoring period. Should they report
symptoms that are suggestive of monkeypox infection, they will be
medically assessed and may be conveyed to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases for further evaluation.
