Published Date: 27 Jul 2020

          As of 27 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 469 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:
A) IMPORTED CASES: 15 (2 Singaporeans, 7 Work Pass holders, 4 Work
Permit holders, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders)
Amongst the 15 imported cases, 2 (Cases 50694 and 50695) are
Singaporeans who returned to Singapore from India on 15 July. Another 11
cases are Work Pass or Work Permit holders who are currently employed in
Singapore. They arrived in Singapore from India or the Philippines
between 14 July and 15 July. Another 2 cases (Cases 50454 and 50696) are
Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from India on 12 July and 14 July.
All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Pass holder)
Both cases in the community are linked to previous cases or clusters,
and were detected due to our proactive screening of persons working at
dormitories, even though they are asymptomatic.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an
average of 10 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 5 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also decreased, from an average of 5 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 3 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 452
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
