A) IMPORTED CASES: 6 (1 Permanent Resident, 2 Work Pass holders, 1 Work
Permit holder, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders)
Amongst the 6 imported cases, 1 (Case 57850) is a Singapore Permanent
Resident who returned to Singapore from India on 16 September. Another 3
(Cases 57849, 57851 and 57860) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders
currently employed in Singapore who arrived from France, the Philippines
and India on 16 September. The remaining 2 (Cases 57857 and 57858) are
Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from India on 15 September.

All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon
arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at
dedicated facilities.

B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2 (2 Work Permit holders)
Both cases in the community were detected as a result of our proactive
surveillance and screening. Case 57847 was tested as part of our
proactive screening of workers in essential services who are living
outside the dormitories, and is currently unlinked. Case 57861 had been
identified as a household contact of Case 57847. When contacted by MOH
on 27 September after Case 57847 was confirmed with COVID-19 infection,
Case 57861 reported having symptoms and was immediately conveyed to a
hospital for a swab. He was tested positive subsequently.
Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked case are in progress. In
the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for his other household contacts
to determine if he could have been infected by them.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at
an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an
average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 7
Amongst the 7 cases residing in dormitories, 4 had been identified
earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined
to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to
determine their status.
The remaining 3 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such
as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
2.      Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.      Of the new cases, 93% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
4.      MOH has been monitoring existing clusters for any further
transmission. As there have been no more cases linked to Changi Lodge II
(80 Tanah Merah Coast Road) and the dormitories at 35 Kian Teck Way and
66 Tech Park Crescent for the past two incubation periods (i.e. 28
days), the clusters have now been closed.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     26 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,393 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.      There are currently 36 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 259 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
