2.      Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained
low, with a total of 1 case in the past week, who is currently unlinked.
We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases
detected through our surveillance programme.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 2
There are 2 cases residing in dormitories today. Both were detected
through our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in
dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including
asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to
prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and
isolating the close contacts.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 7
Amongst the 7 imported cases, 1 is a Singaporean (Case 58203) and
another is a Singapore Permanent Resident (Case 58202) who returned from
the Philippines and India respectively. Another case (Case 58205) is a
Dependant’s Pass holder who arrived from Bangladesh. Another 3 cases are
currently employed in Singapore. Of these, Cases 58204 and 58206 are
Work Pass holders who arrived from the UAE and Germany, and Case 58207
is a Work Permit holder who arrived from Bangladesh. The remaining case
(Case 58201) is a Special Pass holder who arrived from the Philippines
to board a ship docked here as a crew member.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
3.   Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
4.      Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
5.    Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.    13 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,937 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.      There are currently 38 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 26 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
