CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 61205 is a 48 year-old female Singapore Permanent Resident who
works as a part-time food packer at Sheera Pte Ltd (5 Kaki Bukit Road
1). Her job does not entail interaction with customers.
She had travelled to India in March 2020, and returned to Singapore on
11 December. She served SHN at a dedicated facility until 25 December
and her test taken on 21 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19.
She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 25 March in preparation for another trip to India.
Her test result came back positive on 26 March, and she was conveyed via
ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).
Another test conducted by the National Public Health Laboratory on 26
March was negative for COVID-19 infection, and her serological test
result has come back positive. She could be shedding minute fragments of
the virus RNA from a past infection, but given that we are not able to
definitively conclude when she had been infected, we will take all the
necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 22
Amongst the 22 imported cases,
• 1 (Case 61226) is a Singaporean and 2 (Cases 61222 and 61223) are
Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India and Kazakhstan.
• 3 (Cases 61208, 61218 and 61221) are Dependant’s Pass holders who
arrived from the Philippines, South Africa and the US.
• 3 (Cases 61212, 61215 and 61230) are Student’s Pass holders who
arrived from India and Indonesia.
• 1 (Case 61213) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from India.
• 12 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Myanmar
and the Philippines, of whom 4 (Cases 61210, 61231, 61237 and 61243) are
foreign domestic workers.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
Case 61226 is a 49 year-old male Singaporean who returned to Singapore
from Kazakhstan on 11 March, and served SHN at a dedicated facility
until 25 March. His on-arrival swab done on 11 March was negative for
COVID-19, as was his test taken on 24 March during SHN. He developed a
cough on the night of 24 March while serving SHN but did not report his
symptom and went home on 25 March after his SHN ended. On 26 March, he
developed a fever and headache and sought medical treatment at a General
Practitioner clinic, where he was tested for COVID-19. His test result
came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day and he was
conveyed to NCID.
4.   Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.    10 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 60,113 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.    There are currently 32 confirmed cases who are still in hospital.
Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition
in the intensive care unit. 113 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 30 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
