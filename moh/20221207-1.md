    <body><h1>Singapore Contributes Usd1 Million to the Global Fund  to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 07 Dec 2022</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As part of our continued commitment to support multilateral efforts in tackling key global health challenges, Singapore has pledged a contribution of USD1 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Singapore recognises that in an interconnected and globalised world, it is in all countries’ interest to work together to strengthen global health. A concerted global effort is needed to build stronger health systems, and increase countries’ capacities to prepare for, prevent, detect and respond to new outbreaks.</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Global Fund is an important pillar of the global health efforts against HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Global Fund’s objectives have evolved to contribute more to global efforts in pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.</p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout COVID-19, many of Global Fund’s existing investments and efforts were rapidly mobilised to respond to the new pandemic threat, underscoring the importance of establishing and maintaining resilient in-country health systems. Many low- and middle-income countries were able to make use of the resources built to fight HIV, tuberculosis and malaria – such as laboratories, supply chains, data systems, diagnostics tools, health workers and community systems – as the foundation of their response to COVID-19.</p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Singapore will continue to work with the Global Fund and other international actors to address key gaps in the global health architecture and help the world build more resilient health systems</body>
