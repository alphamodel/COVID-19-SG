Those interested can look forward to taking up roles such as workshop facilitators for mental well-being programmes, mentors for at-risk students, and content creators for online mental well-being support platforms.</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Network was set up in February 2020 to bring together people from all walks of life to develop ground-up solutions to improve youth mental well-being.
