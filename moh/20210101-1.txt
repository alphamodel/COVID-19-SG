CASE DETAILS

A)  CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 3

There are 3 cases in the community today, of whom 1 is currently
unlinked and 2 are linked to previous cases.

Case 58870

Case 58870 is a 14 year-old female Singaporean who is a friend of Case
58843[1]. On 27 December 2020, she visited Case 58843 at her home for a
few hours while Case 58810[2] was present as well. As a result, she was
identified as a close contact of Case 58810 on 29 December, and placed
on quarantine. She developed a fever the next day and was conveyed to KK
Women’s and Children’s Hospital in an ambulance, where she was tested
for COVID-19. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection
on 31 December. Her serological test result has come back negative,
indicating that this is likely a current infection.

She is a student of Raffles Girls’ School, but had not been in school
since October 2020.



Case 58872

Case 58872 is a 52 year-old female Singaporean who is a family member of
Cases 58817[3], 58840[4] and 58841[5], and household member of Cases
58840 and 58841. She developed symptoms on 28 December and sought
medical treatment at a general practitioner clinic the next day. She was
advised by the doctor to take a COVID-19 test, but she did not do so.
She was also given 5 days’ medical leave, during which she had to remain
at home.

As she was identified as a close contact of Cases 58840 and 58841, she
was placed on quarantine on 31 December and reported being unwell when
contacted by MOH. She was immediately conveyed to the National Centre
for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in an ambulance, where she was tested.
Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same
day. Her serological test result has come back negative, indicating that
this is likely a current infection.

She works as a client analyst at Deutsche Bank (One Raffles Quay) but
does not interact with clients or external parties. Her last day of work
was 28 December.

We urge everyone to take the COVID-19 test when advised by your doctor,
so as to allow us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly
contain further spread.



Case 58874

Case 58874 is a 53 year-old male Japanese who is a Work Pass holder. He
arrived in Singapore from Japan on 26 November and was placed on SHN at
a dedicated facility until 10 December. A pre-departure test he had
taken on 24 November was negative for COVID-19 infection, and his test
on 6 December during SHN came back negative as well.

He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 31 December in preparation for his return to
Japan. His result came back positive for COVID-19 infection that night
and he was conveyed to NCID the next day. His serological test result
has come back positive.

He is employed at Kurosawa & Partners Pte Ltd (18 Robinson Road) but
works from his home located at Rochor Road.

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them



B)  CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0

There are no cases residing in dormitories today.



C)  IMPORTED CASES: 27

Amongst the 27 imported cases,

•  1 (Case 58875) is a Singaporean and 4 (Cases 58847, 58848,
58849 and 58862) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from
Indonesia, India and Myanmar.
•  5 (Cases 58845, 58846, 58860, 58861 and 58871) are Work
Pass holders who arrived from UAE and India.
•  16 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Indonesia,
India, Myanmar and the Philippines, of whom 14 (Cases 58844, 58851,

arrived from Indonesia to visit his Singaporean child.

They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.

3.  Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.



INVESTIGATIONS INTO 13 CASES WHO SERVED SHN AT MANDARIN ORCHARD
SINGAPORE

5.  MOH announced on 19 December that we were investigating 13
previously reported cases[6] of COVID-19 infection amongst individuals
who had served SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore between 22 October and
11 November 2020. We have since completed investigation into these 13
cases and determined that there was no further transmission beyond them.
The other COVID-19 cases who had served SHN at Mandarin Orchard
Singapore were determined to be unlinked to the 13 cases. All the hotel
staff tested under our special testing operations tested negative for
COVID-19 infection using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The
serological tests of 11 staff are positive, indicating likely past
infections. These findings indicate that there is no ongoing
transmission at Mandarin Orchard Singapore.

6.  In view that the premises have been thoroughly
disinfected, and there is no longer risk of transmission to hotel
guests, MOH has approved the re-opening of Mandarin Orchard Singapore
from 2 January 2021 (14 days after its closure on 19 December),
including its restaurant and event spaces.



UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

7.  10 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged
from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 58,459 have
fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from
hospitals or community care facilities.

8.  There are currently 56 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 85 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
