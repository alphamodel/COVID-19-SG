Joint Statement by MOH and Mnd On Testing Operations



JOINT STATEMENT BY MOH AND MND ON TESTING OPERATIONS


Published Date: 23 May 2021

        The Ministry of Health (MOH) will be conducting polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) testing at the housing blocks as stated below. These are
blocks where infected cases have been located, and testing is done as a
precaution to prevent any possible spread in the community. In the event
that a positive case is detected, MOH will isolate the case, identify
all close contacts, test and quarantine them to protect the community
from further transmission. We will also report updates on any positive
cases in our daily press releases.
2.      So far, there is only one Housing & Development Board (HDB)
block in Singapore with infected cases seen in more than two households.
The tests are typically completed within 3 days.

BLOCK 506 HOUGANG AVENUE 8

3.      MOH had identified 10 COVID-19 cases[1], from four different
households, residing at 506 Hougang Avenue 8. They are largely Persons
Under Quarantine who turned positive for COVID-19. This means that they
have been isolated early and ring- fenced, and not likely to be moving
around while being infectious. Nevertheless, MOH took all the necessary
public health measures to prevent any further spread to the community.

4.      We have established that four of the units with confirmed cases
are in the same stack, and our initial assessment is that airborne
transmission along the stack is highly unlikely. Epidemiological
investigations are ongoing to determine linkages and the source of
transmission.
5.      We are therefore not taking any chances. The National
Environment Agency (NEA) has worked with the town council (TC) to carry
out stepped up cleaning measures to clean and disinfect the block. At
the same time, we are casting our surveillance net as wide as possible,
including administering PCR tests for the whole block.
6.      MOH has just concluded mandatory PCR tests for 407 residents and
visitors of the block. This was done from 21 to 22 May 2021. Thus far,
one individual was found to be positive for COVID-19 with 126 more test
results pending. More details on the positive case will be reported in
upcoming press releases by MOH.
7.      Those who are still awaiting their test results are advised to
stay at home and seek immediate medical attention if they feel unwell.
Individuals who missed their test can proceed to any of the clinics in
the Annex between 23 and 24 May 2021 for the mandatory free swab test.
They are to bring along their NRIC and TraceTogether Tokens, for
identification purposes.
BLOCK 559 PASIR RIS STREET 51
8.      Adopting the same cautious approach, MOH will be conducting
mandatory PCR tests on 23 May and 24 May 2021 for all 243 residents of
Block 559 Pasir Ris Street 51, as four COVID-19 cases[2] have been
detected in two different households living in the block.
9.      Residents are advised to go to Coral Regional Screening Centre
(Former Coral Primary School) between 23 May to 24 May, 9 am to 12 noon,
and 1pm to 4 pm for their tests.
10.      Residents can call MOH at 1800-333-9999 if they have queries.

STEPPED UP MEASURES BY HDB and NEA
11.      The HDB worked with MOH to contact residents living in the
affected block to take the PCR test. HDB also deployed safe distancing
ambassadors to ensure that safe management measures are in place in the
swab ops centre set up at the void deck of the block.
12.      Officers from NEA were deployed to closely monitor the cleaning
and disinfection works carried out at Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8 and
Block 559 Pasir Ris Street 51 by the TCs and their cleaning contractors,
to ensure that they were performed in accordance with NEA’s guidelines.
Cleaning and disinfection works forBlock 506 Hougang Avenue 8 and Block
559 Pasir Ris Street 51 were completed on 21 May and 22 May
respectively, with particular attention placed on frequently touched
areas, such as lift surfaces, lift buttons, handrails, letterboxes,
amongst others. As a precautionary measure, NEA had also worked with the
TCs to expand the scope of disinfection to include amenities in the
vicinity that could be used by residents, such as playground and central
refuse chute.
13.      In line with tighter precautionary measures to reduce the
spread of COVID-19 in the community, NEA has reminded all TCs to step up
their cleaning standards and implement measures to upkeep good public
health hygiene such as increasing the frequency of cleaning of areas
with high contact points and adhering to good practices reflected in
NEA’s advisory on sanitation and hygiene.

ADVISORY ON PROVISION OF SERVICES
14.     We are testing the residents in these two blocks as a
precaution. The residents are not under quarantine. They are allowed to
leave their homes and continue with activities allowed under the
prevailing Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) measures. Delivery of goods and
services such as cylinder gas, food and general repair works to their
premises can still carry on with the appropriate safe management
measures and wearing of masks. We strongly urge service providers to
continue to extend their services to the residents and support our
fellow Singaporeans.
