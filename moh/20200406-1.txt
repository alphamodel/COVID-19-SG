PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Fengshan

4.            Further epidemiological investigations have uncovered a
link between the PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Fengshan Blk 126 cluster to
a family member of Case 601. The cluster, with 27 confirmed cases[5],
consisted of a family cluster of 11 cases[6] who are family members of
Case 601. With the assistance of the Singapore Police Force, our
investigations revealed that Case 566 had travelled to Malaysia on 4
March and was likely infected there. She subsequently transmitted the
infection to other family members, including Case 601. The rest of the
affected staff members of the preschool likely became infected by Case
601 through a staff meeting.

5.            Among the 66 cases announced yesterday that were pending
contact tracing, our investigations have established links for 22 of the
cases, and further investigations are ongoing.

6.            Contact tracing is underway for unlinked cases to
establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected
countries or regions.

identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a
precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their
last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts
who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.
