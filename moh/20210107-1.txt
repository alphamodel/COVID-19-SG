CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 2
There are 2 cases in the community today who are currently unlinked.
_Case 59059_
Case 59059, a 43 year-old female Malaysian, is a Work Permit holder who
works at Azur at Crowne Plaza Changi Airport (75 Airport Boulevard). Her
job entails delivering pre-packed meals to air crew and hotel guests.
She does not interact with diners at Azur.
She developed symptoms while at work on 3 January, and sought medical
treatment at a general practitioner clinic on 5 January where she was
tested for COVID-19 under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. Her result came back
positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and she was conveyed in an
ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.
Her serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this
is likely a current infection. Preliminary investigations reveal that
she is probably not infected with the B117 strain. Her earlier tests
from Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) – the last being on 31 December –
had been negative for COVID-19 infection.
_Case 59069_
Case 59069 is a 63 year-old male Singaporean who works as a cargo
operator at AirMark Aviation (S) Pte Ltd, and is based at Dnata Cargo
Centre (45 Airport Cargo Road). He mainly handles loading and unloading
of cargo for My Indo Airlines, and does not interact with flight
passengers.
He developed ARI symptoms on 4 January, and sought treatment at Changi
General Hospital on 6 January. He was confirmed to be positive for
COVID-19 infection on the same day, and was warded. His serological test
result is pending. Prior to hospitalisation, he had gone to work after
symptoms onset.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 31
Amongst the 31 imported cases,
-  4 (Cases 59040, 59056, 59057 and 59060) are Singaporeans and 3 (Cases

All cases, except Case 59042, had been placed on SHN upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.
Case 59042 arrived from Bangladesh on 22 December but could not clear
