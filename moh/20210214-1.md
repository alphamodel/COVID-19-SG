&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased from 2 cases in the week before to 7 cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from 2 cases in the week before to 4 cases in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amongst the 101 confirmed cases reported from 8 February to 14 February, 48 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 26 have tested negative, and 27 serology test results are pending.<br><br><strong>Case Details<br></strong><br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 0<br></strong><br>There are no cases in the community today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0<br></strong><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 14<br></strong><br>Amongst the 14 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>• 2 (Cases 60219 and 60224) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India and Malaysia.<br>• 1 (Case 60222) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from the UK.<br>• 8 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Indonesia, Japan and Myanmar, of whom 5 (Cases 60215, 60229, 60230, 60233 and 60236) are foreign domestic workers.<br>• 3 (Cases 60216, 60218 and 60221) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders. Cases 60216 and 60221 arrived from India to visit family members who are Singapore Permanent Residents.&nbsp;<br><br>Of these, 13 had already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.&nbsp;<br><br>Case 60218, a 28 year-old male Dutch national, is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who is in Singapore for a work project. He arrived from the Netherlands on 10 February, and tested negative for COVID-19 upon arrival in Singapore. He was subsequently on a controlled itinerary, which was largely limited to his place of work on a vessel docked in Singapore and his accommodation. As part of our regular testing of such travellers, he was tested again on 12 February and his test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection. He was asymptomatic at the time of testing, but developed a fever on 13 February. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Given his recent travel history, we have classified this as an imported case.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the <a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/moh-press-release---annex-a-and-b-(14-feb-2021)-(1).pdf?sfvrsn=83f02ce9_0" title="Annexes">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH’s daily Situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases<br></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;17 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,621 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are currently 32 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 118 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>14 FEBRUARY 2021</strong></span></span></p></body>
