Updates On Border Measures for Travellers From Australia and Jiangsu
Province, Mainland China



UPDATES ON BORDER MEASURES FOR TRAVELLERS FROM AUSTRALIA AND JIANGSU PROVINCE, MAINLAND CHINA


Published Date: 31 Jul 2021

     The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the local
and global COVID-19 situation and regularly reviews Singapore’s border
measures to manage the risk of importation from travellers and onward
local transmission, taking into account the current situation in their
source countries/ regions. We will be tightening our border measures in
AUSTRALIA and JIANGSU PROVINCE, MAINLAND CHINA.
TRAVELLERS FROM AUSTRALIA TO SERVE 14-DAY SHN AT DEDICATED SHN
FACILITIES
2.     As there has been a recent increase in cases reported by
Australia, all travellers entering Singapore from 2 AUGUST 2021, 2359
HOURS, with travel history in the past 21 days to AUSTRALIA will be
subjected to a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN
facilities. Travellers will also be allowed to apply to opt out¹ of
dedicated SHN facilities before arrival and serve their 14-day SHN at
their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:
a) Travelled to no other country/region other than Australia², in the
last consecutive 21 days immediately prior to entry into Singapore; and
b) Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address)
alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN
with the same travel history and duration of SHN.
3.     Travellers will be required to present a valid negative COVID-19
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken within 72 hours before
departure for Singapore. Travellers who arrive in Singapore without a
valid negative test may be denied entry into Singapore. Permanent
Residents (PRs) and long-term pass holders who fail to comply with the
new requirement may have their permit or pass cancelled. Beyond the
14-day SHN, travellers will be subjected to the following tests:
a) On-arrival PCR test³ and PCR test on Day 14 of arrival; and
b) Self-administered ART test on Day 3, 7 and 11 of arrival⁴.
TRAVELLERS FROM JIANGSU PROVINCE, MAINLAND CHINA TO SERVE A 7-DAY SHN AT
PLACE OF RESIDENCE
4.     We had earlier announced that travellers from Mainland China will
be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore, without a need to
serve SHN, if their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test results are negative.
5.     Given the increased cases observed in Jiangsu province, we will
be tightening border control measures for travellers with travel history
to Jiangsu province.
6.     From 2 AUGUST 2021, 2359 HOURS:
a) Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs) and Long-Term
Pass holders entering Singapore with travel history to Jiangsu province,
Mainland China within the last 21 days before departure for Singapore,
will be subject to an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, a 7-day SHN at their
place of residence and a COVID-19 test before the end of the SHN period.
b) Short-term travellers holding an Air Travel Pass (ATP) with travel
history to Jiangsu province, Mainland China within the last 21 days
before departure for Singapore, will not be allowed to enter Singapore.
7.     All other travellers departing from Mainland China who have been
in Mainland China (excluding Jiangsu province) in the last 21 days prior
to travel will continue to be subject to a COVID-19 test upon arrival at
the airport in lieu of their SHN.
8.     As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our
border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to
the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the
SafeTravel website.
