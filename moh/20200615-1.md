    <p>Published Date: 15 Jun 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 15 June 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 214 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 0<br></strong><br>There are no imported cases today.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 3 </strong>(3 Work Permit holders)<br><br>There are no Singaporean/ Permanent Resident cases today. All 3 cases in the community are Work Permit holders who were detected as a result of our efforts to screen workers in essential services, even though they are asymptomatic.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 9 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 8 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 3 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 211<br></strong><br>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>). Please refer to <a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/moh-press-release---annex-a-(15-jun-2020).pdf?sfvrsn=7c353002_0" title="Annex A">Annex A</a>&nbsp;for the summary of the confirmed cases.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of the new cases, 99% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Inter-Agency Task Force has been systematically and progressively clearing dormitories through aggressive testing of migrant workers residing in dormitories. Westlite Juniper (23 Mandai Estate) and the dormitory at 21 Defu South Street 1 have been cleared, and now house only recovered individuals and those who have recently tested negative for COVID-19 infection. As such, the clusters have now been closed.<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; We announced on 13 June that a student at St Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School had tested positive for COVID-19. As a precaution, 47 students and 12 staff who had been in close contact with the student have been put on Leave of Absence by the Ministry of Education or Home Quarantine Order by MOH. The 47 students and 12 staff have been tested for COVID-19, and their test results have all come back negative.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the past week (8 June to 14 June), MOH has uncovered links for 11 previously unlinked cases.&nbsp;<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.
