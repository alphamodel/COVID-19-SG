    <title>Gradual Re-opening of Travel and Changes to Border Measures  </title>
    <body><h1>Gradual Re-opening of Travel and Changes to Border Measures  </h1>
    <p>Published Date: 15 Jun 2020</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has announced the plans for a progressive re-opening of our economy and society. The Taskforce has also been reviewing the border measures that we had put in place to manage the risks of importation, and will likewise be implementing progressive changes as we re-open to international travel. These include ongoing discussions with various countries/regions on developing bilateral arrangements for safe travel, and allowing more Long Term Pass holders still outside Singapore to return.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have been monitoring the global situation closely to determine the risk of importation from abroad. Countries/regions are at various stages of putting in place effective systems to control the infection. We will therefore update our border measures, taking into account our understanding of the virus, as well as the developments in these countries/regions.<br><br><strong>Testing of All Incoming Travellers&nbsp;<br></strong><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since 21 March 2020, all incoming travellers, including Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holders<sup>[1]</sup>, have been required to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).Besides the SHN, we will now put in place a testing regime for all incoming travellers before the end of their SHN.The testing regime will apply to all travellers entering Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours. It is an additional precautionary measure to detect the virus, especially given the risks of asymptomatic cases. We will monitor the results of these tests and may make adjustments to the testing requirements over time.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The test will be scheduled a few days before the end of the SHN period, at a designated community testing facility. Each person under SHN will receive information on the scheduled appointment slot and venue via an SMS notification. They will have to travel from their place of residence to the designated testing facility, and return immediately after the test, using their own private vehicle or designated transport. Public transport should be avoided.<br><br><strong>Travellers from Some Countries/Regions to Serve Stay-Home Notice at Suitable Place of Residence&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;With the testing regime in place, we will also update the existing requirement for all incoming travellers to stay at dedicated SHN facilities. For a start, all travellers entering Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, and who had remained in Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam in the last consecutive 14 days prior to their entry, will no longer have to serve their SHN at dedicated SHN facilities:<br><br>&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents may serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence.</p><p>&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Long Term Pass holders may serve their 14-day SHN at a place of residence that they or their family members own or are sole tenants of; or in suitable accommodation such as a hotel, at their own cost.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All persons under SHN must remain in their place of residence at all times. They will be subject to close monitoring of their whereabouts, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks. Strict enforcement action will be taken against those who breach the requirements of the SHN.<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All other travellers entering Singapore will continue to serve their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, for now.<br><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above changes, all Long Term Pass holders will continue to require prior approval before entering Singapore<sup>[2]</sup>. As the global and local health situations improve, we have gradually increased the number of entry approvals given to Long Term Pass holders, especially those with deep roots to Singapore or have exigent circumstances. We expect to be able to facilitate the re-entry of more Long Term Pass holders in the coming weeks. We will also study how to facilitate business travels, in particular for professionals based in Singapore who need to travel frequently as part of their work, with the necessary safeguards.<br><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For now, we are not yet allowing short-term visitors, except those coming in under the Green / Fast Lane arrangements (starting with China, and eventually covering more countries/regions), or with special prior approval.<br><br><strong>Travellers to Bear Costs of COVID-19 Tests and Stay at Dedicated SHN Facilities<br></strong><br>10.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has thus far borne the costs of stay at dedicated SHN facilities for travellers entering Singapore, except for those who left Singapore from 27 March 2020 despite the prevailing travel advisory. The Government has also borne the costs of the large majority of COVID-19 tests.<br><br>11.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, as we re-open our borders to more international travel, those who enter Singapore would have to bear the costs of fulfilling these requirements, as part of the cost of travel in a COVID-19 world.<br><br>12.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, all inbound and outbound travellers who enter Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, and leave Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, respectively, will be required to pay for their COVID-19 tests, where applicable. In addition, incoming travellers who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents, who enter Singapore from 17 June 2020, 2359 hours, will be required to pay for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, where applicable.<br><br>13.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore’s measures for inbound travellers in relation to COVID-19, including the new ones announced in this press statement, are summarised in <u><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-a---measures-for-inbound-travellers-(15-june-2020).pdf?sfvrsn=612afe28_0" title="Annex A">Annex A</a></u>.<br><br>14.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The prevailing charges for the COVID-19 test and stay at the dedicated SHN facilities are set out in <u><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annex-b---charges-for-covid-19-test-and-stay-at-dedicated-shn-facility-(15-june-2020).pdf?sfvrsn=f85a78f1_0" title="Annex B">Annex B</a></u>.<br><br>15.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore’s border measures will evolve as the global situation changes, we encourage everyone to check the MOH website (<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19">https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19</a>) for the latest updates.<br><br><strong>Updated Travel Advisory<br></strong><br>16.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;All Singaporeans and residents of Singapore are still advised to defer all travel abroad. However, essential business and official travel will be permitted under Green/ Fast Lane arrangements<sup>[3]</sup>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>15 JUNE</strong><strong> 2020</strong></p> <div><br clear="all"> <hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"> <div id="ftn1"> <p><sup>[1]</sup>&nbsp;Long Term Pass (LTP) holders refer to Work Pass holders, Student’s Pass holders, Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders and Dependant’s Pass holders, as well as those who have been granted In-Principle Approval (IPA) for a LTP. </p> </div> <div id="ftn2"> <p><sup>[2]</sup>&nbsp;Except for those returning under the Singapore-China Fast Lane arrangements, as separate arrangements would have been put in place for this group.&nbsp; </p> </div> <div id="ftn3"> <p><sup>[3]</sup>&nbsp;As of 15 June 2020, this comprises the Singapore-China Fast Lane.</p> </div> </div></body>
