CASE DETAILS

A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory who is currently unlinked. Case
59243 is a Work Permit holder who arrived from India on 11 December
2020, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 25 December. His swab
done on 21 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19.
He resides at Seatown Dormitory and started work in the construction
sector on 6 January 2021. He tested negative again for COVID-19 on 27
December. However a subsequent test taken on 12 January as part of
Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) came back positive for COVID-19
infection. His serological test result is positive.
Given the relatively long time interval between his travel and positive
COVID-19 test, we have classified this case as locally transmitted while
epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including his dormitory contacts
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be
tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can
detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them.

C) IMPORTED CASES: 37
Amongst the 37 imported cases,

-   3 (Cases 59222, 59237 and 59240) are Singaporeans and 5 (Cases

    respectively. Case 59238 arrived from Brazil to participate in an
    eSport event.

They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in

Case 59229 is a sea crew who worked onboard bunker tanker _NewOcean 6_.
He had been identified as a close contact of Case 58812[1], and was
placed on quarantine on 31 December. He was tested during quarantine and
confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 12 January.
3.     Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the meantime,
all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and
placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their
quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also
conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the
cases could have been infected by them.
