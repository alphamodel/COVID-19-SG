Termination of Jesselton Dental Centre From Chas



TERMINATION OF JESSELTON DENTAL CENTRE FROM CHAS


Published Date: 13 Jan 2021

         The Ministry of Health (MOH) has, on 10 December 2020, served a
notice of intended termination on Resilient Healthcare Group Pte Ltd,
for the intended termination of Jesselton Dental Centre  from the
Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS). The termination will take effect
from 16 January 2021.
2.      Audits on Jesselton Dental Centre conducted in late 2018 to 2019
revealed severe non-compliances, including numerous improper claims for
CHAS subsidies with no proper supporting documentation and claims that
exceeded the allowed limit.
3.      MOH was informed on 27 April 2020 that the ownership and
licensee of Jesselton Dental Centre had been transferred from Resilient
Healthcare Group Pte Ltd to Alliance Management Group Pte Ltd. This
cessation of Resilient Healthcare Group Pte Ltd as the licensee, coupled
with the extent of Jesselton Dental Centre’s non-compliance, made the
termination of the clinic from CHAS necessary. MOH will continue to
investigate the clinic even with the change in ownership.
4.     The termination from CHAS means that Jesselton Dental Centre will
no longer be allowed to make claims for CHAS subsidies on behalf of its
patients. Affected patients may wish to visit other nearby CHAS
accredited dental clinics instead. Jesselton Dental Centre, which is now
under the new ownership of Alliance Management Group Pte Ltd, will
however be allowed to continue treating patients as long as its dentists
hold valid registration and practising certificates from the Singapore
Dental Council. We have received a new application for CHAS
accreditation from Alliance Management Group Pte Ltd and will assess the
application accordingly.
5.     MOH encourages patients to actively engage their doctors and
dentists if they have any queries on their bills. CHAS, Pioneer
Generation and Merdeka Generation cardholders who wish to check on
claims for CHAS subsidies made on their behalf, may do so by logging
into the “MY CHAS” module on the CHAS website (www.chas.sg) or by
calling the CHAS hotline (1800-275-2427).
6.     If they come across any suspicious or unusual claims for CHAS
subsidies made on their behalf, they may contact MOH at 1800-225-4122 or
send their feedback to MOH_QSM@moh.gov.sg. MOH also reminds healthcare
professionals to uphold a high standard of professionalism and to adhere
to their Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines.
7.     MOH takes a serious view of such errant practices and will not
hesitate to take enforcement actions where required, including referral
of the errant healthcare professionals to their respective professional
boards.
