Update On Vaccine Category Name



UPDATE ON VACCINE CATEGORY NAME


Published Date: 23 Jun 2021

          The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine currently used in our national
vaccination programme is manufactured at various sites across Europe and
labelled according to the regulatory approval in various markets.

2.  As we accelerate our vaccine supplies, we will be receiving a
batch of vaccines called “ComirnatyTM”. These vaccines are the same as
the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that we have been using in our national
vaccination programme, with the same research name BNT162b2. They are
manufactured according to the same processes and procedures, and meet
the same finished product specifications as the Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccines. They are similarly manufactured in Europe and shipped directly
to Singapore. The only difference is in their label.

3.  The Ministry of Health will be adjusting the HealthHub
records of individuals who have received or will be receiving the
Pfizer-BioNTech or ComirnatyTM vaccine to administratively reflect the
vaccine received under a category called “Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty”.
