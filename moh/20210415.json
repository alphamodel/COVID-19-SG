There was extensive narrowing of the three main blood vessels supplying blood to the muscles of the heart due to atherosclerosis (build up of plaques over time in the blood vessels that obstruct blood flow).<br></p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article \u201cCorrections and Clarifications Regarding Falsehoods on COVID-19 Vaccination\u201d at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gov.sg/article/factually150421  \" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\"></a><a href=\"https://www.gov.sg/article/factually150421\" target=\"_blank\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gov.sg/article/factually150421&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618539805061000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPZ0_OS8-eZ7C-2H8h4-oRoXcXTw\">https://www.gov.sg/article/<wbr>factually150421</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COVID-19 vaccines that are used in Singapore have been assessed to be safe and efficacious by both the HSA and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination.
