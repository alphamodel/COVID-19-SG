2.       Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained
stable at 4 cases per week in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked
cases in the community has increased from 2 cases in the week before to
3 cases in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these
numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance
programme.
3.       Amongst the 95 confirmed cases reported from 28 February to 6
March, 56 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 26 have
tested negative, and 13 serology test results are pending.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 60666 is a 35 year-old female Indonesian national who is a foreign
domestic worker. She arrived in Singapore on 20 January 2021 and served
SHN at a dedicated facility until 3 February. Her swab done on 2
February during SHN was negative for COVID-19, as was her pre-departure
test taken on 18 January while she was in Indonesia.
She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 4 March in preparation for her return to
Indonesia. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection,
and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in
an ambulance. Another test taken by the National Public Health
Laboratory (NPHL) on 5 March came back negative for COVID-19 infection,
and her serological test result has come back positive, which indicates
a likely past infection. She is likely to be shedding minute fragments
of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to
others. However as we are unable to definitively confirm her date of
infection, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a
precautionary measure, including placing all her identified close
contacts on quarantine.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 12
Amongst the 12 imported cases,
• 1 (Case 60671) is a Singaporean and 1 (Case 60673) is a Singapore
Permanent Resident who returned from Indonesia and Malaysia.
• 2 (Cases 60669 and 60672) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived
from India.
• 1 (Case 60664) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from India.
• 7 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Myanmar and the Philippines, of whom 3 (Cases 60674, 60678 and 60695)
are foreign domestic workers.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
Case 60664, a 27 year-old female Indian national, is a Work Pass holder
who has not started work yet. She arrived in Singapore on 8 February and
served SHN at a dedicated facility until 22 February. Her test taken
during SHN on 21 February was negative for COVID-19. As part of her
pre-employment health screening, she was tested for COVID-19 on 4 March
even though she is asymptomatic, and her test came back positive.
Another test taken by NPHL on 5 March was negative for COVID-19
infection, and her serological test result has come back positive. She
had also earlier tested positive for a COVID-19 antigen test in India on
18 November 2020. Given that these indicate likely past infection, we
have classified the case as imported. She is likely to be shedding
minute fragments of the virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and
infective to others.
4.       Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.       Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.       9 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,879 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.       There are currently 22 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 90 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
