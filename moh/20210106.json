His job entails delivering pre-packed meals to air crew and hotel guests. He does not interact with diners at Azur. \n<br>\n<br>He tested positive for a pooled swab during Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) on 2 January, and was tested again on 4 January. On the same day, he started to develop acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. His individual test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 5 January, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. He has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests. \n<br>\n<br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Case 59034\n</span><br>\n<br>Case 59034 is a 31 year-old male Filipino who arrived from the Philippines on 4 December, and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 18 December.

As part of his pre-employment health screening, he was tested for COVID-19 on 5 January even though he is asymptomatic, and his test came back positive. He was subsequently conveyed to SGH in an ambulance. His serological test result has come back positive, which indicates a likely past infection.\n<br>\n<br>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them\n<br>\n<strong><br>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0\n</strong><br>\n<br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today. \n<br>\n<br><strong>c) Imported cases: 29\n</strong><br>\n<br>Amongst the 29 imported cases, \n<br>\n<br>\u2022 1 (Case 59025) is a Singaporean and 2 (Cases 59026 and 59033) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from UK and India.\n<br>\u2022 1 (Case 59006) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from India. \n<br>\u2022 5 (Cases 59003, 59004, 59007, 59008 and 59030) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India, Indonesia and UAE. \n<br>\u2022 16 are Work Permit holders who arrived from India, Indonesia and Myanmar, of whom 12 (Cases 59011, 59012, 59013, 59014, 59017, 59018, 59019, 59020, 59021, 59029, 59031 and 59032) are foreign domestic workers.\n<br>\u2022 1 (Case 59022) is a sea crew holding a Special Pass who arrived from China on board a vessel.
