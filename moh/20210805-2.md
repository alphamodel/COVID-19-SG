    <body><h1>Updates On Border Measures for Travellers From Taiwan</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 05 Aug 2021</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the global COVID-19 situation. As the situation in Taiwan has improved, we will allow travellers from Taiwan to undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arrival, and to go about their activities in Singapore if the PCR test result is negative.</p><p><strong></strong><strong>Updated Border Measures for Travellers from Taiwan</strong></p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;We had earlier announced that travellers from Taiwan will be subjected to an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at a dedicated SHN facility (or opt out to serve at their place of residence), and a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of the SHN period.</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; As the situation in Taiwan has improved:</p><p>a.&nbsp; &nbsp; From&nbsp;<strong>7 August 2021, 2359 hours</strong>, all travellers entering Singapore with travel history to Taiwan, within the last 21 days before departure for Singapore, will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival [1], and will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore if the PCR test result is negative. They will not need to serve a 14-day SHN period.<br><br>b.&nbsp; &nbsp; Short-term visitors with travel history to Taiwan, within the last 21 days before departure for Singapore, can apply for an Air Travel Pass with immediate effect, for entry into Singapore on or after&nbsp;<strong>12 August 2021</strong>. They will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival, and will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore if the PCR test result is negative.</p><p>c.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Travellers who are already serving their 14-day SHN at their place of residence as of 7 August 2021, 2359 hours will still be required to complete their 14-day SHN and exit swab.</p><p><strong>Regular Review of Border Measures<br></strong><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the&nbsp;<a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/">SafeTravel website</a>. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry.</p><p></p><div><p><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong>5 AUGUST 2021</strong></p></div><div><br clear="all"><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"><div id="ftn1"><p>[1] To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the checkpoints, travellers are strongly encouraged to register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore at&nbsp;<a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/">https://safetravel.changiairport.com/</a>&nbsp;(for Changi Airport) and&nbsp;<a href="https://t.2c2p.com/express/parkwayshenton">https://t.2c2p.com/express/parkwayshenton</a>&nbsp;(for Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal).</p></div></div></body>
