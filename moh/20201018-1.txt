2.      Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained
stable at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks.
The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable
at an average of fewer than 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will
continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected
through our surveillance programme.
3.        Of the new cases, 71% are imported or linked to known cases/
clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case
58073 was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all
individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory
infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to
identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further
spread. He is a technician but had not gone to work after onset of
symptoms. His serological test result has come back positive, which
indicates likely past infection.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 1
There is 1 case residing in a dormitory today. He was detected through
our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories.
This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so
that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further
transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the
close contacts.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 5
Amongst the 5 imported cases, 4 are currently employed in Singapore. Of
these, 2 (Cases 58071 and 58072) are Work Permit holders who arrived
from the Philippines and another 2 (Cases 58074 and 58075) are Work Pass
holders who arrived from Greece and France. The remaining case (Case
58070) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from Guatemala. They had
all been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while
serving SHN.
4.    Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).
5.         Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
6.       Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex A and Annex B for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
7.     9 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 57,807 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
8.        There are currently 40 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the
intensive care unit. 36 are isolated and cared for at community
facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically
well but still test positive for COVID-19. 28 have passed away from
complications due to COVID-19 infection.
