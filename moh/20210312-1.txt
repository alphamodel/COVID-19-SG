2.         Overall, the number of new cases in the community has
remained stable at 3 cases per week in the past 2 weeks. The number of
unlinked cases in the community has increased from 2 cases in the week
before to 3 cases in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor
these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance
programme.
3.         Amongst the 73 confirmed cases reported from 6 March to 12
March, 39 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 29 have
tested negative, and 5 serology test results are pending.
CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 60831 is a 36 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass
holder. He arrived from India on 16 January and served SHN at a
dedicated facility until 30 January. His test taken on 29 January during
SHN was negative for COVID-19. He works as an IT Engineer at Deutsche
Bank but has been working from home since his arrival in Singapore.
He developed a runny nose on 1 March and sought medical treatment at a
General Practitioner clinic on the same day. As he declined to be tested
for COVID-19, he was given 5 days of medical leave and advised to return
for a test if he did not recover. He was subsequently detected on 11
March when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test in preparation for his
trip to India. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection
on the same day, and he was conveyed to the National Centre for
Infectious Diseases in an ambulance. His serological test result has
come back positive, which indicates a likely past infection.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including his household contacts,
have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the
start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close
contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.
We strongly urge everyone to play their part to reduce the risk of
transmission. Those who are advised by their doctor to be tested for
COVID-19 should do so, even if they are showing early/mild symptoms.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 9
Amongst the 9 imported cases,
• 1 (Case 60850) is a Student’s Pass holder who arrived from Indonesia.
• 2 (Cases 60830 and 60851) are Work Pass holders who arrived from
Indonesia and Switzerland.
• 4 (Cases 60837, 60840, 60842 and 60848) are Work Permit holders who
arrived from Indonesia and the Philippines, all of whom are foreign
domestic workers.
• 2 (Cases 60826 and 60827) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders who
arrived from Cambodia and Indonesia. They were already receiving medical
care in Singapore and had returned for further treatment.
They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and
were tested while serving SHN.
