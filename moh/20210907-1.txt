UPDATE ON VACCINATION PROGRESS
       As of 6 September 2021, we have administered a total of 8,804,737
doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme
(Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty and Moderna), covering 4,536,986 individuals,
with 4,385,405 individuals having completed the full vaccination
regimen.
2.    In addition, 171,961 doses of other vaccines recognised in the
World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been
administered as of 6 September 2021, covering 86,204 individuals. In
total, 81% of our population has completed their full regimen/ received
two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 83% has received at least one dose.

4.    There is continuing evidence that almost all fully-vaccinated
individuals do not suffer serious disease when infected, unless if they
had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible. Over
the last 28 days, the percentage of unvaccinated who became severely ill
or died is 6.1%, while that for the fully vaccinated is 0.8%.
