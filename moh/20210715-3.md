    <body><h1>Updates On Vaccination Records</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 15 Jul 2021</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">1.&nbsp; &nbsp;We have made good progress in our national COVID-19 vaccination programme thus far. As of 14 July 2021, we have administered around 6.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Around 4 million individuals have received at least the first dose of the vaccine, of whom about 2.4 million have completed the full vaccination regimen.</span></p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Updates of Vaccination Records for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long-Term Pass Holders Vaccinated Overseas</strong><br></p> <p style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;">2.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">As vaccinations grow in availability worldwide, there are also many Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders who have returned from overseas with vaccinations done abroad and would like their vaccination records updated in Singapore.</span></p><p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;">3.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">From 14 July 2021, such individuals who have received COVID-19 vaccinations overseas with COVID-19 vaccines </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">authorised by the Heath Sciences Authority under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR)[1] or&nbsp;listed on the World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) can have their vaccination records updated in the National Immunisation Registry when they return to Singapore. To do so, they should have documentation to show proof of their overseas vaccination and a positive serology test result in Singapore. The positive serology test provides an additional means to validate the vaccination status of an individual by detecting that antibodies have been mounted against the virus.</span></p></p><p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;">4.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">To update their vaccination records in Singapore, individuals can visit a private healthcare provider onboard this initiative[2] with</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;their overseas COVID-19 vaccination documentation. Upon positive serology test result, the individual’s vaccination records will subsequently be reflected on HealthHub after a few days. For Singapore residents who received their COVID-19 vaccination in Singapore, serology testing is not required.</span></p></p><p><p><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Keeping our Community Safe</strong><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;">5.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Vaccination remains a key enabler in our fight against COVID-19 and its ability to help Singapore re-open safely can only be felt when we can collectively achieve a high level of population coverage for vaccination. We encourage those who still have not done so, to register their interest via vaccine.gov.sg and book their vaccinations and get vaccinated.</span></p></p> <p style="margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p> <div style="padding: 0in 0in 1pt; border-top: none; border-right: none; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left: none;"> <p style="padding: 0in; border: none;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;"><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</strong></span></p> </div><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;"> <strong>15 JULY 2021</strong> </span><div><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;"><br clear="all"> </span><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"> <div id="ftn1"> <p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;">[1] PSAR approved vaccines are Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Moderna vaccines</span></p> </div> <div id="ftn2"> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial;">[2] Details on the providers can be found at: <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs/faqs---post-vaccination-matters"><span style="color: black;">https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs/faqs---post-vaccination-matters</span></a></span></p> </div> </div></body>
