The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 13</strong> (1 Singaporean, 1 Work Pass holder, 4 Work Permit holders, 4 Dependant\u2019s Pass holders, 1 Long-Term Visit Pass holder, 2 Short-Term Visit Pass holders)<br><br>Amongst the 13 imported cases, 1 (Case 56203) is a Singaporean who returned to Singapore from India on 7 August. Another 5 (Cases 56201, 56202, 56217, 56223 and 56270) are Work Pass/ Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore, who arrived from the Philippines between 7 August and 9 August, and the UK on 10 August. An additional 4 cases (Cases 56220, 56271, 56275 and 56276) are Dependant\u2019s Pass or Long-Term Visit Pass holders who arrived from India on 10 August and the UK between 8 August and 10 August. The remaining cases (Cases 56242 and 56243) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders who arrived from India on 7 August and the Philippines on 9 August. They were allowed entry into Singapore because 1 is a spouse and caregiver of a patient who has been receiving medical treatment in Singapore and another is employed on a project basis to work in Singapore.&nbsp;<br><br>All the cases had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were serving their SHN at dedicated facilities. They had been tested while serving their SHN.<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 6</strong> (3 Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, 3 Work Permit holders)<br><br>Of the 6 cases in the community, 4 were picked up as a result of our proactive surveillance and screening, and 1 had already been placed on quarantine earlier. 4 of them are asymptomatic, and were detected through our proactive testing.<br><br>There is 1 case in the community today (Case 56244) who had been identified as a contact of a previously confirmed case. He had been placed on quarantine earlier, and was tested during quarantine to determine his status.&nbsp;<br><br>5 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 3 cases (Cases 56187, 56190 and 56269) were identified as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories. Another case (Case 56200) was tested as part of our efforts to screen individuals working in frontline COVID-19 operations. The remaining case (Case 56184) was detected under our enhanced community testing to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us to identify infected individuals early and to quickly contain further spread.&nbsp;<br><br>Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to determine if these cases could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we also conducted serological tests to determine if some of these cases are current or past infections.&nbsp; The serological test results for Cases 56200 and 56244 have come back positive, which indicate likely past infections. The test results for the remaining cases are pending.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has remained stable at an average of 2 cases per day in the past 2 weeks. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also remained stable at an average of 1 case per day in the past 2 weeks. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 98</strong><br><br>The Inter-agency Taskforce has completed the testing of all workers in the dormitories. There are currently about 14,300 workers who are still serving out their quarantine period. These workers will be tested when their quarantine ends, and we expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (<a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

In all, 53,651 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are currently 72 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 2,466 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>21 AUGUST 2020</strong><br></span></p><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><br></span></div>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "532-more-cases-discharged-117-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-confirmed", "CurrentPageUrl": null}, {"Title": " Updates On Border and Community Measures", "PublishedDate": "/Date(1598007600000)/", "LastModifiedDateTimeList": null, "PublishedDateStr": "21 Aug 2020", "Summary": "", "MainContent": "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has reviewed our border measures to manage the risks of importation and onward local transmission from travellers. We will update the travel advisory to allow general travel to Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand, as well as travel for overseas studies. Travellers from Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand will be subject to a COVID-19 test upon arrival, in lieu of a Stay-Home Notice (SHN). We will also reduce the SHN duration from 14 days to 7 days for travellers from low risk countries/regions.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to allow a calibrated resumption of economic and social activities, while putting in place measures where needed to ensure that activities can continue to be conducted safely. Outdoor exercise classes will be allowed to resume on certain conditions, while additional measures will be put in place to manage crowds, as well as to ensure continued safe dining-in at F&amp;B outlets. Businesses and individuals need to play their part in ensuring that community transmission remains low.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update on Border Measures</strong></p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recognise that the risk of importation from travellers varies across countries/regions as they are at different stages of putting in place effective systems to control the infection. We have taken a risk managed approach to our border controls and calibrated our border measures based on the assessed risk of importation and onward transmission in the community.</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 21 March 2020, we have implemented a 14-day SHN on all incoming travellers (i.e. Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders [1]) to minimise the risk of importation leading to community spread in Singapore. Since 18 June 2020, we have also allowed travellers from selected low risk countries/regions \u2013 Australia (excluding Victoria State), Brunei Darussalam, Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam \u2013 to serve their 14-day SHN at their own place of residence. &nbsp;A testing regime before the end of SHN has also been put in place for all incoming travellers.&nbsp;</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have monitored the situation and assessed that there are several countries/regions where the virus situation is well under control and the risk of importation is low. We will therefore update our border measures accordingly. Changes will be with effect <strong>from 1 September 2020, 0000 hours</strong>, for all travellers entering or departing Singapore.</p><p><u></u><u>Opening up Entry to Visitors from Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand</u></p><p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst these low-risk countries, we will start by lifting our current border restrictions to allow the entry of visitors from Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand into Singapore. Travellers entering Singapore and who have remained in either Brunei Darussalam or New Zealand in the last consecutive 14 days prior to their entry [2]&nbsp;will not be required to serve a SHN. Instead, they will undergo a COVID-19 test upon arrival at the airport and only be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore after receiving a negative test result.</p><p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to travelling to Singapore, visitors from Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand will need to apply for an Air Travel Pass (ATP) between 7 and 30 days before their intended date of entry into Singapore. They will be responsible for their medical bills should they require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore. Application for the ATP will start from 1 September 2020 for travel from 8 September 2020. More details will be provided by the Ministry of Transport next week.</p><p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders[3]&nbsp;will similarly not have to serve SHN and will undergo a COVID-19 test upon arrival. They do not need to apply for an ATP.</p><p><u>Reduced SHN of 7 Days for Travellers from Low Risk Countries/Regions</u></p><p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other low risk countries/regions where an SHN may also not be needed. But out of abundance of caution we will keep the SHN for now.&nbsp; However, we will shorten the SHN duration from the current 14 days to 7 days, and allow travellers to serve the SHN at their place of residence[4]. These low risk countries/regions are Australia (excluding Victoria State), Macao, Mainland China, Taiwan, Vietnam, and &nbsp;Malaysia. The COVID-19 test will continue to be administered before the end of the 7-day SHN.</p><p>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All other incoming travellers will continue to serve their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, and will be subject to a test before the end of the SHN. Existing travel conditions, including adherence to SHN requirements[5]&nbsp;and applying for relevant approvals[6]&nbsp;before entering Singapore, continue to apply. Travel conditions under specific travel arrangements (such as Green/Fast Lane arrangements and Periodic Commuting Arrangement with Malaysia), will also continue to apply. Persons serving SHN are reminded to use only the permitted modes of transport and avoid taking public transport.</p><p><u>Update on Travel Advisory</u></p><p>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the lifting of border restrictions to visitors from Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand, we will update the travel advisory to allow general travel to Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand<strong>. </strong>Travellers to Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand are advised to check the entry requirements imposed by these countries, and take the necessary precautionary measures.</p><p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also update the travel advisory to allow travel for studies for students pursuing academic qualification overseas, and where distance-learning is not offered as an option by the education institution.[7]</p><p>13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans and residents of Singapore are advised to defer all other forms of travel overseas. Essential travel for business, official and work purposes will continue to be permitted under Green/Fast Lane arrangements and the Periodic Commuting Arrangement. When overseas, travellers should take all necessary precautions, observe good personal hygiene, monitor local developments, and heed the advice of local authorities.</p><p>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All travellers will be subject to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities and tests, where applicable[8]. Travellers who have complied with the travel advisories will be eligible for Government subsidies, and MediShield Life (MSHL) and Integrated Shield Plan (IP) coverage for their COVID-19 treatment should they have onset of symptoms within 14 days of their return to Singapore and require hospital admission for suspected COVID-19 infection.</p><p><u>Regular Review of Border Measures</u></p><p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore\u2019s border measures will evolve as the global situation changes. We will continue to monitor the global health situation closely and update our border measures in accordance with the public health risk assessment. If the situation in a country/region deteriorates, more stringent measures will be put in place to limit the risk of importation and prevent community transmission from imported cases. We encourage everyone to check the MOH website regularly for the latest updates.</p><p><strong>Update on Community Measures</strong></p><p><u>Resumption of Outdoor Exercise Classes at Public Spaces</u></p><p>16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the beginning of Phase Two, organised exercise classes conducted by instructors have been allowed to take place in both private and public sports facilities subject to respective premise owners\u2019 permission and conditions, in groups of five (with a 2-metre safe distancing between individuals unless the activity requires otherwise and a 3-metre safe distancing between groups), up to a total class size of 50 persons, or lower depending on the venue capacity and safe distancing measures.</p><p>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1 September 2020, we will expand the list of public facilities where such classes can be held to include more open spaces at SportSG sport centres, parks, and HDB common areas. These classes in newly opened areas must be organised by an instructor who will be responsible for ensuring that the safe management measures are put in place and adhered to. These measures include temperature and symptoms screening, safe distancing, and maintaining a list of participants in venues where SafeEntry is not deployed. The instructor must be registered to conduct these activities, and more details on the registration process will be released subsequently. Instructors and participants should follow the stipulated safe management measures as well as any other conditions stipulated by the premise owner. General group exercises that are not organised by these instructors will continue to be capped at five persons, in addition to any conditions stipulated by the premise owner.</p><p><u>Continued Calibrated Approach in Managing Crowds</u></p><p>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As general activity increases, it may not be practicable to maintain a 1-metre safe distancing requirement in some specific settings, such as public transport. As more activities resume, lift lobbies have also become increasingly crowded. To reduce the risk of overcrowding in lifts and lift lobbies, we will put in place stringent safe management measures in lifts while exempting them from the 1-metre safe distancing requirement. These safe management measures include wearing of masks, refraining from speaking, and using hand sanitisers provided in lifts, which will ensure a safe lift ride for all. Lift users should continue to observe safe distancing in lift lobbies.</p><p>19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, some mall managers have been facing persistent challenges in managing crowds and ensuring safe distancing. Based on trends observed since the start of Phase Two, Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza, in particular, attract large crowds and long queues to enter on weekends. To better manage crowds and ensure that safe distancing can be observed both inside and outside the buildings, from 29 August 2020, the two malls will implement odd and even date entry restrictions on weekends, based on the last digit of an individual\u2019s National Registration Identification Card (NRIC) or Foreign Identification Number (FIN). More details will be provided by Singapore Tourism Board and Enterprise Singapore separately. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to monitor the situation closely, and other malls or premises that face similar crowd management issues may also be required to adopt this entry restriction.</p><p><u>Continued Safe Dining-in at F&amp;B Outlets</u></p><p>20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past few weeks, some F&amp;B outlets have been observed to be playing extremely loud music, causing patrons to have to talk more loudly to be heard which increases the risk of droplet spread. Patrons at some of these outlets were also found to be not wearing their masks for prolonged periods, with some even mixing with persons from other tables. Our Safe Distancing Enforcement Officers will not hesitate to take enforcement action against such errant operators and patrons who put themselves and other patrons at risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As an added precaution, we will tighten the rules to allow recorded music at F&amp;B outlets to be played as soft background music only. Live music, live broadcasts (both TV and radio) as well as video screenings remain disallowed.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also urge everyone to refrain from booking multiple tables for large gatherings in F&amp;B outlets, and also seek the cooperation of F&amp;B outlets not to accept such reservations. Households with more than five persons and who wish to dine out together may book more than one table to accommodate everyone in the household. They should however limit their interactions between tables. Other than that, there should not be organized events, celebrations or parties in an F&amp;B setting involving multiple tables, and where people are mingling amongst themselves without their masks on. Our Enforcement Officers will step up their checks in F&amp;B outlets and take enforcement action against any breaches of safe distancing rules by the individuals or the F&amp;B operators.</p><p><u>Playing Our Part in the Fight Against COVID-19</u></p><p>23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We urge everyone to do their part to ensure that our businesses and public spaces can continue to be safe spaces for all, by observing safe distancing and avoiding peak periods and crowded places. In addition, all who are unwell, including those showing early/mild symptoms of cough, sore throat, runny nose, loss of smell, should see a doctor immediately and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others. This is the best way we can protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our community.</p><div><hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"><div id=\"ftn1\"><p>[1] Long Term Pass (LTP) holders refer to Work Pass holders, Student\u2019s Pass holders, Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders and Dependant\u2019s Pass holders, as well as those who have been granted In-Principle Approval (IPA) for a LTP.</p></div><div id=\"ftn2\"><p>[2] For direct travel from Brunei Darussalam and New Zealand into Singapore only.</p></div><div id=\"ftn3\"><p>[3] LTPHs need to apply for ALE as per arrangement today</p></div><div id=\"ftn4\"><p>[4] Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents may serve their 7-day SHN at their place of residence.
