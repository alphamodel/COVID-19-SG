on quarantine on 1 January at a quarantine facility. His swab done on 3
January was negative for COVID-19. Another test taken on 7 January came

ambulance. His serological test result has come back negative,
indicating that this is likely a current infection. He has also tested
preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further
confirmatory tests.
Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members
and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be

detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for
the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by
them.
