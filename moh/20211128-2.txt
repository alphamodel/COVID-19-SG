Deferment of Vaccinated Travel Lanes With Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the
United Arab Emirates



DEFERMENT OF VACCINATED TRAVEL LANES WITH QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA, AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES


Published Date: 28 Nov 2021

        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been closely monitoring the
global COVID-19 situation and regularly reviews Singapore’s border
measures to manage the risk of importation from travellers and onward
local transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified
Omicron (B.1.1.529) as a variant of concern. As a precautionary measure
to reduce the risks of importation and spread, we will DEFER THE LAUNCH
OF OUR VACCINATED TRAVEL LANES WITH QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA AND THE UNITED
ARAB EMIRATES (UAE).
DEFERMENT OF VACCINATED TRAVEL LANES WITH QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA, AND UAE
2.     We had previously announced that we will be launching Vaccinated
Travel Lanes (VTLs) with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE from 6 December
2021, with applications for the Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) for
short-term visitors and long-term pass holders opening on 29 November
2021.
3.     On 26 November 2021, the WHO classified a potentially more
contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus, known as Omicron (B.1.1.529),
as a variant of concern. Scientists around the world are presently
working to determine the characteristics of the new Omicron variant,
such as whether it is more transmissible than the Delta variant, and if
it is more likely to lead to severe illnesses. Singapore has not
detected any cases of this variant to date.
4.     As a precautionary move to reduce the risks of importation and
spread of the Omicron variant to Singapore, we will be DEFERRING THE
COMMENCEMENT OF THE VTLS FOR QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA AND THE UAE UNTIL
FURTHER NOTICE. This is in view of their proximity as transport nodes to
the affected countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe¹. We will provide more details on
the commencement of these VTLs at a later date.
REGULAR REVIEW OF BORDER MEASURES
5.     We are reviewing our border measures, and will announce more
details soon.
6.     As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our
border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID resilient
nation. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel
website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check the latest
border measures for the associated country or region before entering
Singapore; and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border
measures upon entry.
