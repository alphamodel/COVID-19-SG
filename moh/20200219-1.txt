FIVE MORE CASES DISCHARGED, THREE NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 19 Feb 2020

1.     Five more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospital today (Cases 1, 32, 33, 44 and 55). In all, 34 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital.

2.  As of 19 February 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified three additional cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. Of these, one is linked to The Life Church and Missions
Singapore and one is linked to Grace Assembly of God. Contact tracing of
the remaining case is underway to establish any links to previous cases
or travel history to China.

LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND

3.  Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. This was
made possible with the assistance of the Singapore Police Force.

    a) Four of the locally transmitted confirmed cases (Cases 31, 33,
38 and 83), as well as Cases 8 and 9, are linked to The Life Church and
Missions Singapore (146B Paya Lebar Road).

    b) Nine of the confirmed cases (Cases 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28,
34 and 40) are linked to Yong Thai Hang (24 Cavan Road).

    c) Three of the confirmed cases (Cases 30, 36 and 39) are linked to
the private business meeting held at Grand Hyatt Singapore from 20 to 22
January.
    d) Five of the confirmed cases (Cases 42, 47, 52, 56 and 69) are
linked to the Seletar Aerospace Heights construction site.

    e) 22 of the confirmed cases (Cases 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 57, 58, 60,
61, 62, 63, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81 and 84) are linked to
the Grace Assembly of God.

4.  Investigations on these clusters are ongoing. In addition to the
clusters, our investigations have identified the following links between
cases:

-   Case 44 is linked to Cases 13 and 26;
-   Case 72 is linked to Cases 59 and 79;
-   Case 50 is linked to Cases 55, 65 and 77; and
-   Case 75 is linked to Case 41.

5.  Contact tracing is underway for the other eight locally
transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel
history to mainland China.

ABOUT THE CONFIRMED CASES

Case 82

6.  Case 82 is a 57 year-old female Singapore Citizen with no recent
travel history to China. She is currently warded in an isolation room at
Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH).

7.  She reported onset of symptoms on 9 February and had sought
treatment at Jurong Polyclinic on 10 February and 14 February, as well
as a general practitioner (GP) clinic on 12 February. She went to the

admitted as a dengue patient in a general ward on 15 February.
Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 18 February
afternoon, and she was immediately transferred to an isolation room.

8.  As a precautionary measure, the patients who had shared the same
room as the case while she was in the general ward have been transferred
to single rooms. They have been tested for COVID-19 infection, and the
results are pending. So far, none of the contacts have any respiratory
symptoms. Contact tracing of NTFGH staff who had been in contact with

disinfected.

UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES

cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving. Four are
in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

UPDATE ON CONTACT TRACING FOR CONFIRMED CASES

19.  Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once
identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a
precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their
last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts
who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance,
and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.

20.  As of 19 February 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 2,593 close
contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 1,172 are currently
quarantined, and 1,421 have completed their quarantine.

HEALTH ADVISORY
21.  Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province
and all non-essential travel to Mainland China.

22.  All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks
upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they
feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel
history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough,
shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead
of the visit.

23.  Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following
precautions at all times:

-   Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms
    of illness;
-   Observe good personal hygiene;
-   Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food
    or eating,

    after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory
    secretions after coughing or sneezing);

-   Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or
    shortness of breath;
-   Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and
    dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and
-   Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.

24.  MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical
practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely
to see more cases that will need to be investigated.
