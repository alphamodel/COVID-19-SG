We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>Case Details</strong><br><br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 2</strong><br><br>There are 2 cases in the community today, both of whom are linked to previous cases.<br><br><em>Case 59393</em><br><br>Case 59393 is a 43 year-old female Singaporean who is the spouse of Case 59365<sup>1</sup>, and a homemaker. She developed a runny nose on 10 January, and subsequently loss of taste, sore throat and diarrhoea on 12 January, but had not sought medical treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As part of our contact tracing efforts, she was contacted by MOH on 16 January following the confirmation of Case 59365, and was tested for COVID-19 when she reported these symptoms. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and she was conveyed to KK Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital in an ambulance. Her serological test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.<br><br><em>Case 59395</em><br><br>Case 59395 is a 66 year-old female Malaysian national who is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder, and has been residing in Singapore since January 2020. She is a retiree who is a family member of Case 59365. She developed acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms and diarrhoea on 9 January, and subsequently loss of taste on 14 January, but had not sought medical treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As she had been identified as a close contact of Case 59365, she was contacted by MOH on 16 January and tested for COVID-19 when she reported these symptoms. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and she was conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital in an ambulance. Her serological test result has come back positive. Together with her COVID-19 symptoms, this indicates a likely recent infection with onset on 9 January.<br><br>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br>We strongly urge everyone to do their part to reduce the risk of transmission. Those who are unwell, including those showing early/mild symptoms, should be socially responsible and seek medical attention immediately.<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 12</strong><br><br>Amongst the 12 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>- 2 (Cases 59394 and 59400) are Singaporeans and 4 (Cases 59388, 59389, 59397 and 59399) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from India, Mexico, Pakistan, Switzerland, UK and US.<br>- 1 (Case 59398) is a Dependant\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from India.<br>- 1 (Case 59392) is a Student\u2019s Pass holder who arrived from Czech Republic.&nbsp;<br>- 4 (Cases 59390, 59391, 59401 and 59402) are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India and Malaysia.&nbsp;<br><br>They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annexesd294d3d374284cf7b4b3f335a9f03771.pdf?sfvrsn=dca2feed_0\" title=\"Annexes \">Annexes </a>and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;22 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
