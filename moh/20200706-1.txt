Published Date: 06 Jul 2020

       As of 6 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
preliminarily confirmed an additional 183 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore, the vast majority of whom are Work Permit holders residing in
foreign worker dormitories. Based on our investigations so far, there
are 23 cases in the community, of whom 3 are Singaporeans/ Permanent
Residents and 20 are Work Pass holders. From our preliminary
investigations, of these 23 cases, 5 were close contacts of earlier
cases, and had already been placed on quarantine. Another 7 are migrant
workers who reside together at a temporary accommodation arranged by
their company. These cases were identified from our periodic screening
of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories,
and some may be past infections. Epidemiological investigations are
ongoing for the other cases.

2.     In addition, there are 3 imported cases, all of whom had been
placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.
3.     We are still working through the details of the cases, and
further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be
issued tonight.
