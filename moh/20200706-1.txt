276 More Cases Discharged 183 New Cases of Covid-19 Infection Confirmed



276 MORE CASES DISCHARGED 183 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION CONFIRMED


Published Date: 06 Jul 2020

      As of 6 July 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified an additional 183 cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:

A)    IMPORTED CASES: 3 (2 Singaporeans, 1 Work Pass holder)
Amongst the 3 imported cases, 2 are Singaporeans who returned to
Singapore from Yemen on 24 June and India on 23 June respectively. The
remaining case (Case 44962) is a Filipino who returned to Singapore from
the Philippines on 24 June. She is a Work Pass holder who is currently
employed in Singapore. All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home
Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while
serving their SHN.
B) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 23 (3 Singaporeans, 1 Work Pass holder, 19
Work Permit holders)
Of the 23 cases in the community, 18 had been picked up as a result of
our proactive surveillance and screening, and 3 had already been placed
on quarantine earlier.
17 of the community cases today are linked to previous cases or
clusters. Of these, 13 had been detected as part of our proactive
screening of workers in essential services or individuals working in
dormitories, even though they are all asymptomatic. Amongst them, 7¹ are
migrant workers who reside together at a temporary accommodation
arranged by their company. Their PCR test results indicate low viral
loads, detectable only after many amplification cycles, which means
these may be past infections. We will conduct serological tests for
these workers to determine if they have current or past infections but
in the meantime, MOH is investigating the possible exposures and links,
and will take appropriate action to prevent further transmission.
Another 3 cases² (Cases 44937, 44990 and 44996) had been identified as
contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been tested during their
quarantine to determine their status. Epidemiological investigations are
ongoing for the remaining case (Case 44858) which is linked to
ASPRI-Westlite Papan dormitory.
6 of the community cases are currently unlinked. Of these, 5 cases
(Cases 44924, 44926, 44931, 44932 and 44936) were tested as they work in
essential services, even though they are all asymptomatic. The remaining
case (Case 44944) had been tested under our enhanced community testing
to test all individuals aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with acute
respiratory infection at first presentation to a doctor. This allows us
to detect infected individuals early and to quickly contain further
spread.
Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased, from an
average of 7 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 12 per
day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has
also increased, from an average of 4 cases per day in the week before,
to an average of 5 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
In the past week, from 29 June to 5 July, about 4 in 10 of the community
cases have been tested serology positive, indicating that they are
likely past infections³.
C) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 157
We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in
dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of
extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify
and test the status of all workers.
2.     Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation
Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex
A for the summary of the confirmed cases.
3.     Of the new cases, 97% are linked to known clusters, while the
rest are pending contact tracing.
LINKS BETWEEN PREVIOUS CASES FOUND
4.    In the past week (29 June to 5 July), MOH has uncovered links for
5 previously unlinked cases.
5.     Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have
uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer
to Annex B and Annex C for details.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.     276 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 40,717 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.     There are currently 208 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 2 are in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 4,032 are isolated and cared for
at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 26 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.

¹Cases 44921, 44922, 44928, 44929, 44930, 44934 and 44935.
²Updated from the afternoon press release as 2 cases have been
re-categorised following further investigation.
³Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past
infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA
picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective
to others.
