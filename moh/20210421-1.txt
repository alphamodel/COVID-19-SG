CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1
There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.
Case 62200 is a 39 year-old male Singapore Permanent Resident who works
as a Systems Engineer at Parkway Pantai. He has been working from home,
and has not returned to his workplace.
He had travelled to India from 9 July 2020 to 24 January 2021. Upon his
return to Singapore, he served SHN at a dedicated facility until 7
February. His test taken on 6 February during SHN was negative for
COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19
pre-departure test on 19 April in preparation for a trip. His test
result came back positive the next day, and he was conveyed in an
ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.
His Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and
his serology test result has come back positive. He could be shedding
minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection which are no
longer transmissible and infective to others, but given that we are not
able to definitively conclude when he had been infected, we will take
all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
