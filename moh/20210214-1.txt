CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 0
There are no cases in the community today.
B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.
C) IMPORTED CASES: 14
Amongst the 14 imported cases,
• 2 (Cases 60219 and 60224) are Singapore Permanent Residents who
returned from India and Malaysia.
• 1 (Case 60222) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from the
UK.
• 8 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Indonesia, Japan and
Myanmar, of whom 5 (Cases 60215, 60229, 60230, 60233 and 60236) are
foreign domestic workers.
• 3 (Cases 60216, 60218 and 60221) are Short-Term Visit Pass holders.
Cases 60216 and 60221 arrived from India to visit family members who are
Singapore Permanent Residents.
Of these, 13 had already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore
and were tested while serving SHN.
Case 60218, a 28 year-old male Dutch national, is a Short-Term Visit
Pass holder who is in Singapore for a work project. He arrived from the
Netherlands on 10 February, and tested negative for COVID-19 upon
arrival in Singapore. He was subsequently on a controlled itinerary,
which was largely limited to his place of work on a vessel docked in
Singapore and his accommodation. As part of our regular testing of such
travellers, he was tested again on 12 February and his test result came
back positive for COVID-19 infection. He was asymptomatic at the time of
testing, but developed a fever on 13 February. His serology test result
has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current
infection. Given his recent travel history, we have classified this as
an imported case.
4.       Please refer to the Annexes and MOH’s daily Situation Report
(www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report) for details.
5.       Epidemiological investigations are in progress. In the
meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been
isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and
end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.
We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to
determine if the cases could have been infected by them.
UPDATE ON CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES
6.       17 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from
hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 59,621 have fully
recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or
community care facilities.
7.       There are currently 32 confirmed cases who are still in
hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 1 is in critical
condition in the intensive care unit. 118 are isolated and cared for at
community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are
clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 29 have passed
away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.
