confirmed and verified that there are 130 cases of locally transmitted
COVID-19 infection, of which 78 are linked to the Jurong Fishery Port

are currently unlinked. Amongst the cases are 2 seniors above 70 years
who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, and are at risk of serious
illness.

2. There are 3 imported cases, who have already been placed on
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. 1 was
detected upon arrival in Singapore, while 2 developed the illness during
SHN or isolation.

3. In total, there are 133 new cases of COVID-19 infection in

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES

6. Overall, the number of new cases in the community has
increased from 178 cases in the week before to 961 cases in the past
week. We are likely to continue to see high number of cases in the
coming days as we step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread
in the community. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also
increased from 18 cases in the week before to 97 cases in the past week.
The 7-day moving average number of all linked community cases and all
unlinked community cases are 123.4 and 13.9 respectively.

Collection of ART self-test kits for visitors to selected markets and
food centres
9.          MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
markets and food centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who
visited Jurong Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the
markets and food centres. As an added layer of ringfencing to help to
identify cases and prevent further transmission, MOH is working with the
People’s Association to distribute antigen rapid test (ART) self-test
kits to individuals who had visited selected markets and food centres in
the last 14 days, such as residents living in the vicinity of these
centres. The collection will run from 24 to 25 July 2021 at Residents’
Committee Centres in the vicinity of the following locations:
-  Admiralty Wet Market (678 Woodlands Avenue 6); and
-  Bukit Timah Market & Food Centre (51 Upper Bukit Timah Road).
10.           Eligible persons are strongly encouraged to collect and
perform self-testing using these ART kits. Please refer
to https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/art to check on the nearest Residents’
Committee Centre for self-collection.
PROGRESS OF NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAMME
11.          As of 22 July 2021, we have administered a total of
6,978,317 doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination
programme. The total number of doses administered was 6,978,317,
covering 4,201,110 individuals. 2,897,480 individuals have completed
