In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.

As a precautionary measure, we will conduct special testing operations for staff who work in White Sands Shopping Mall. To pre-emptively mitigate any potential risk of wider, undetected community transmission, we will also offer free COVID-19 testing for members of the public who had visited White Sands Shopping Mall from 2 May to 11 May. MOH will progressively inform these individuals via SMS notification with information on how to book an appointment for their test. All visitors to White Sands Shopping Mall from 2 May to 11 May are also advised to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

The resumption of clinical attachments and training for healthcare students will take place from 31 May. As an additional precaution, all patients transferring from TTSH and other acute hospitals to intermediate and long-term care (ILTC) facilities will be tested for COVID-19 within 48 hours of their scheduled transfer. We advise patients to defer non-urgent visits to TTSH as it reopens its clinical services progressively.<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;19 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.
