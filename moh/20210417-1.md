    <body><h1>4 New Cases of Locally Transmitted Covid-19 Infection</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 17 Apr 2021</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As of 17 April 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 4 new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. Based on our investigations so far, the cases are in the community, and there are no new cases in the dormitories.</p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, there are 35 imported cases, who had already been placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore. Amongst them, 10 are Singaporeans or Singapore Permanent Residents, and 8 are foreign domestic workers.</p><p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In total, there are 39 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore today.</p></p><p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.</p></p><p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The recent locally transmitted cases are a stark reminder that the virus has not been eradicated and new cases and clusters can easily emerge in our community, if we let our guard down. We urge everyone, including those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19, to continue to exercise social responsibility, and keep up our discipline in adhering to the safe management measures. This is even more critical as we resume and scale up more activities in Phase Three of re-opening, and interactions in the community increase. Together we must work to avoid an uncontrolled resurgence of cases that may necessitate a tightening of measures.</p></p></body>
