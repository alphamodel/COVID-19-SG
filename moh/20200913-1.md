    <p>Published Date: 13 Sep 2020</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As of 13 September 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 49 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>Summary of new cases<br></strong><br>Amongst the new cases today, 47 are asymptomatic, and were detected from our proactive screening and surveillance, while 2 were symptomatic.&nbsp;<br></span></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"></span></span></p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"> <tbody><tr> <td width="241" valign="top"> <p>&nbsp;</p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"> </span></td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Already in quarantine/ isolation before detection </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Detected from surveillance </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Total</strong></span></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="241" valign="top"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Imported cases</strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">8</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">0</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">8</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="241" valign="top"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Cases in the community </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">0</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">1</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">1</span></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="241" valign="top"> <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;"><strong>Cases residing in dormitories </strong></span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">31</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">9</span></p> </td> <td width="120"> <p align="center"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 14px;">40</span></p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br><strong>a) Imported cases: 8</strong> (1 Singaporean, 1 Permanent Resident, 4 Work Permit holders, 2 Dependant’s Pass holders)<br><br>Amongst the 8 imported cases, 1 (Case 57513) is a Singaporean and 1 (Case 57542) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned to Singapore from India on 5 September and 10 September. Another 4 (Cases 57497, 57525, 57526 and 57527) are Work Permit holders currently employed in Singapore who arrived from the Philippines on 30 August. The remaining cases (Case 57533 and 57537) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived from India and the US on 30 August.&nbsp;<br><br>All of them had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their SHN at dedicated facilities.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases in the community: 1</strong> (1 Work Permit holder)<br><br>There is a case in the community today who is currently unlinked. Case 57520 was detected as a result of our Rostered Routine Testing of workers in the construction, marine and process sectors who are living outside the dormitories, even though he is asymptomatic.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased, from an average of 2 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 1 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>c) Cases residing in dormitories: 40<br></strong><br>Amongst the 40 cases residing in dormitories, 31 had been identified earlier as contacts of previous cases, and had already been quarantined to prevent further transmission. They were tested during quarantine to determine their status.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The remaining 9 cases were detected through surveillance testing, such as our bi-weekly Rostered Routine Testing of workers living in dormitories. This allows us to pick up cases early, including asymptomatic ones, so that we are able to ring-fence them quickly to prevent further transmission, by aggressively containing, tracing and isolating the close contacts.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, we have also conducted serological tests to determine if some of the cases are current or past infections. <sup><span style="font-size: 12px;">[1]</span></sup> The serological test results for 14 cases have come back positive so far, which indicate likely past infection.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (<a href="http://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report/" title="" class="" target="">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>).

In all, 56,764 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; There are currently 60 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 555 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>13 SEPTEMBER 2020</strong><br><br>==<br><span style="font-size: 12px;">[1]&nbsp;Cases whose serological tests are positive are likely to have a past infection, and could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA picked by the PCR test, which were no longer transmissible and infective to others.<br></span></span></span></p><div><br></div></body>
