    <body><h1>Antigen Rapid Test Kits Vending Machines  Deployed Islandwide and  Updates to Home Recovery and Travel Classifications </h1>
    <p>Published Date: 17 Sep 2021</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; We have seen a continued rise in local COVID-19 cases. The great majority of these cases have exhibited no or mild symptoms. We will continue to calibrate our safe management measures, test extensively and contact trace as widely as possible to identify and reduce serious infections early. We will also make testing more pervasive by proliferating the use of Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits within our community and at our workplaces, and adjust our healthcare protocols to better navigate the current wave of transmissions.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Local Situation Update<br><br></strong>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; text-align: left;">Even as our infection cases rise - the average number of cases increased from 146 cases per day a fortnight ago, to 682 cases per day in the past week – the number of serious cases, for now, remains low. As of 16 September, there are 77 cases requiring oxygen supplementation, and 12 in critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU). They represent 1.6% and 0.1% of total infections over the last 28 days. &nbsp;<br><br>3. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">This has largely been brought about by the vaccination programme, which has covered 82% of our residents to date. The occurrences of severe illnesses are not even, concentrating mostly on older and unvaccinated infected individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See&nbsp;</span><u style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-a19909d862a444b2eb3dc0caf6c335c63.pdf?sfvrsn=3fd4d6cb_0" title="Annex A">Annex A</a></u><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.) Nevertheless, we are still early in this new wave of transmission and must continue to stay vigilant.<br><br>4. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">To this end, we will press on with our vaccination booster efforts,</span><span style="text-align: left; font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">and will continue to proliferate pervasive testing in the community and at our workplaces. We will also review our healthcare protocols to identify opportunities to facilitate more home recovery and isolation, as part of our transition to a COVID-19 resilient nation.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"></span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Vending Machines Deployed Islandwide to Support Distribution of ART Kits<br><br></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">5. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">The Ministry of Health (MOH) is deploying 100 vending machines across 56 locations islandwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vending machines will be available for 24/7 access from&nbsp;<strong>18 September 2021</strong>. More information on the&nbsp;Health Risk Warnings (HRW) and Health Risk Alerts (HRA), the full list of collection points and the steps for collection of the ART self-test kits is available at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://gowhere.gov.sg/art" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;" title="" class="" target="">gowhere.gov.sg/art</a><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.<br><br>6. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Individuals who receive an HRW SMS notification must get an entry polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic or Private Practitioner (PP)[1]</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">, and self-isolate until they receive a negative result from their first PCR test. They will also be required to perform self-administered ART tests on the third, fifth and seventh day from the day of last exposure to the COVID-19 case whom they were close contacts with, followed by another exit PCR test on or after the eighth day at a SASH clinic or PP. If all these are complied with, their HRW period will end on the tenth day of exposure. All swab costs will be borne by the Government.<br><br>7. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">From&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">18 September 2021</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;onwards, individuals who are informed of their HRW or HRA status by MOH through SMS will also receive instructions on the frequent testing regime that they must follow. To facilitate this, such individuals may scan their Singapore-issued ID (NRIC/FIN) to collect a pack (comprising three ART self-test kits) at a nearby vending machine, and use the ART kits for self-testing to fulfil the requirement for HRW. Please refer to&nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-b72b0e86f3dfa46f090590f4f74ffc690.pdf?sfvrsn=404aae0f_0" title="Annex B">Annex B</a></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;for the list of locations for these vending machines.<br><br>8. &nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">From&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">18 September 2021,&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">individuals who receive an HRA SMS notification should perform a self-administered ART test on the first, third and fifth day from the day of last exposure to the COVID-19 case whom they were potentially close contacts with, and monitor their health until the tenth day of exposure. All who have been issued a HRW or a HRA can use their government-distributed kits to perform the required self-administered ART tests. We urge all on HRA to exercise social responsibility and limit their interactions with other persons during that period.<br><br></span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Expanding the Suitability of Home Recovery Individuals&nbsp;<br><br></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">9.</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">We have made Home Recovery the default care management model for suitable COVID-19 patients less than 50 years old from 15 September 2021. 597 fully vaccinated COVID-19 patients, including 13 children between 5 to 11 years old have successfully started their home recovery journey. This is close to a third of the community cases for the past two days, which is highly encouraging, as we see more individuals taking personal empowerment to take care of their own health and recovery. Since the pilot started from 30 August 2021, 32 of them have been discharged.&nbsp;<br><br>10. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Data continues to show that fully vaccinated individuals are indeed less at risk of severe illness, especially those under the age of 70 years. Hence, we will be further expanding the suitability criteria for Home Recovery to now include fully vaccinated individuals up to the age of 69 years. This allows more COVID-19 patients to recover within the comfort of their homes, and for us to further direct our hospitals resources to those who really need more intensive care.&nbsp;<br><br>11. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">From&nbsp;<strong>18 September 2021</strong>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Home Recovery will be the default care management model for individuals who are:<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">a. &nbsp;Fully vaccinated;<br>b. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Aged 12 to 69 years old;<br>c. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">No severe co-morbidities or illnesses;&nbsp;<br>d. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Able to self-isolate in a room, preferably with an attached bathroom; and<br>e. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Have no household members who are more than 80 years old or are in one of the vulnerable groups (e.g. pregnant individuals or with weakened immune response).</span></p></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">12. &nbsp; Individuals tested positive for COVID-19 and meet the above criteria can begin Home Recovery immediately, without having to be conveyed to a hospital or Community Care Facility.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">We continue to urge all fully vaccinated COVID-19 individuals below the age of 70 to adopt Home Recovery as the default care management, just like how you would recover from, say, Influenza. Please continue to self-isolate from your household members until you receive confirmation of your PCR test results. If you are confirmed COVID-19 positive, please refer to the&nbsp;10-step guide on our Home Recovery website&nbsp;at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://go.gov.sg/home-recovery" title="" class="" target="">go.gov.sg/home-recovery</a>.<br><br></span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Updates to Travel Classifications in our Calibrated Measures at our Borders&nbsp;<br><br></strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">13. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has also been closely monitoring the global COVID-19 situation and continues to update the country risk classification periodically.&nbsp;&nbsp;The updated classification, together with the associated testing requirements, can be found in&nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-ceec8f5888ae24cacbaf20c3e42d9c8ba.pdf?sfvrsn=682ab99e_0" title="Annex C">Annex C</a></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><p style=""><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">a. &nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Category II</u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">:&nbsp;This would include countries/regions such as&nbsp;Australia, Brunei, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea today. We have reviewed the COVID-19 situation in&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Poland and Saudi Arabia</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;and will also add them to this category from&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">22 September 2021, 2359 hours</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.<br><br>b. &nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Category III</u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">: We have reviewed the COVID-19 situation in&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Latvia, Portugal and Spain&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">and will add them to this category from</span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;22 September 2021, 2359 hours</strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccinated travellers from these countries may apply to serve their 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at a suitable accommodation of their choice (e.g. residential address, hotels or serviced apartments), if they fulfil the criteria listed in&nbsp;</span><u style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><a href="/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-d2875892c5d334fdebd50bf6858e62023.pdf?sfvrsn=ca46c6d1_0" title="Annex D">Annex D</a></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to undergo a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.<br></span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><br></span><em style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Resumption of Transits and Removal of On-arrival ART for Travellers from Indonesia&nbsp;<br><br></em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">14. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">We had previously announced that all travellers with a 21-day travel history to Indonesia would not be allowed to transit through Singapore, and those entering Singapore would also be required to undergo an on-arrival ART (on top of the on-arrival PCR test). As the situation in Indonesia has shown improvement, all passengers with travel history to Indonesia within the last 21 days prior to departure for Singapore will be allowed to transit through Singapore from&nbsp;<strong>22 September 2021, 2359 hours</strong>. In addition, travellers from Indonesia entering Singapore will be required to undergo an on-arrival PCR test[2]&nbsp;instead of an ART[3]&nbsp;plus a PCR test.&nbsp;&nbsp;Travellers with travel history to Indonesia within the last 21 days prior to departure for Singapore will be subject to Category IV border measures.<br><br>15. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID-19 resilient nation. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;" title="" class="" target="">SafeTravel website</a><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures for the associated country or region before entering Singapore; and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry.</span></p></p><p style="text-align: left;"><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Working together towards COVID-19 resiliency<br><br></strong>16. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">Our current transmission levels are in line with those experienced by similar countries on a path towards COVID-19 resilience. While our vaccinations have allowed us to keep severe illness low among those who are infected, we need all Singaporeans to remain vigilant and continue working together by exercising civic consciousness and personal responsibility so that we can dampen the rate of transmission together and ride this wave of infections safely. To this end, we seek everyone’s continued cooperation to come forward for vaccination if you have not yet done so, seek medical care if feeling unwell, practise good hand hygiene, self-test regularly, and self-regulate social interactions at a restrained level. Together, we will emerge stronger.<br><br></span><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br></strong><strong style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px;">17 SEPTEMBER 2021</strong></p></p><div><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%" style="text-align: left;"><div id="ftn1" style="text-align: left;"><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">[1] PCR tests can be taken at the following PPs: Fullerton Health Testing Centre, Raffles Hospital or Kingsway Medical Clinic.
