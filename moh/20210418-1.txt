2.    Overall, the number of new cases in the community has increased
from 2 cases in the week before to 8 cases in the past week. The number
of unlinked cases in the community has also increased from 2 cases in
the week before to 5 cases in the past week. We will continue to closely
monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our
surveillance programme.
3.   Amongst the 178 confirmed cases reported from 12 April to 18 April,
55 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 91 have tested
negative, and 32 serology test results are pending.

CASE DETAILS
A) CASES IN THE COMMUNITY: 1

There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.

Case 62113 is a 39 year-old male Indonesian national who is a sea crew
on board a bunker tanker. He had not disembarked from the vessel except
to go for COVID-19 testing and vaccination.

He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 15 April as
part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back
positive for COVID-19 the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance
to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. An individual test done
on 16 April also came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day.
His earlier tests from RRT – the last being on 1 April – had all been
negative for COVID-19 infection. His serological test result has come
back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.

Case 62113 received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccination on 15 April.
As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been
infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just
before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for
an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the
identified close contacts of the case, including the crew members of the
vessel, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested
at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect
asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close
contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.

B) CASES RESIDING IN DORMITORIES: 0
There are no cases residing in dormitories today.

C) IMPORTED CASES: 22

Amongst the 22 imported cases,

-   5 (Cases 62108, 62119, 62134, 62135 and 62136) are Singapore
    Permanent Residents who returned from India.
-   2 (Cases 62101 and 62123) are Dependant’s Pass holders who arrived
    from Nepal.
-   1 (Case 62109) is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from
    India.
-   5 (Cases 62103, 62104, 62129, 62132 and 62133) are Work Pass holders
    who arrived from India and Kazakhstan.
-   5 (Cases 62105, 62106, 62107, 62112 and 62130) are Work Permit
    holders who arrived from Bangladesh and India.
-   4 (Cases 62110, 62111, 62120 and 62121) are Short-Term Visit Pass
    holders. Cases 62110 and 62121 are sea crew who arrived from the
    Philippines and Myanmar respectively. Case 62110 was placed on SHN
    upon arrival in Singapore, and Case 62121 had not disembarked and
    was tested onboard. Cases 62111 and 62120 arrived from Indonesia and
    Romania for work assignments in Singapore.

They had all already been placed on SHN or isolated upon arrival in
Singapore and were tested while serving SHN or during isolation.

Case 62110 is a 43 year-old male Filipino sea crew who arrived from the
Philippines on 24 March to board a vessel that is docked in Singapore.
His on-arrival test on 24 March was negative for COVID-19. He served SHN
at a dedicated facility from 24 March to 7 April, and his test done on 6
April during SHN was also negative for COVID-19. He boarded his
designated vessel on 8 April, where he had not disembarked from. On 16
April, he was tested as part of the Maritime and Port Authority of
Singapore’s protocol to test sea crew, and was conveyed to a hospital
when his test came back positive for COVID-19 infection. His Ct value
was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load, and his serology
test result has also come back positive. Given that these indicate
likely past infection, we have classified the case as imported based on
his travel history. He is likely to be shedding minute fragments of the
virus RNA, which are no longer transmissible and infective to others.
