Closure of Chinatown Complex and Community Surveillance Testing for
Visitors
6. MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection amongst individuals
who work in Chinatown Complex (335 Smith Street). A total of 66 cases
are currently linked to the cluster. Of these, 63 work at Chinatown
Complex, comprising 58 stallholders and stall assistants, 4 cleaners and
1 Safe Distancing Ambassador working at the Complex. The remaining 3 are
household contacts of cases. To break any potential chain of
transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, Chinatown Complex
will be closed to all members of the public from 1500 hours, 12
September to 2359 hours, 15 September 2021.
7. All staff working at Chinatown Complex are being tested for COVID-19.
To cast a wide net around the cases, and to contain the cluster quickly,
persons who have logged in with SafeEntry to Chinatown Complex from 8
September to 11 September will be issued Health Risk Alerts (HRA). They
are strongly encouraged to go for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
as soon as possible and to reduce their social interactions for 14
days.
8. To uncover any community infection cases, we will also extend free
COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited Chinatown
Complex between 8 September and 11 September, but who do not receive
HRAs. Please refer to https://go.gov.sg/chinatown-complex-testing for
details on the testing operations. All visitors to Chinatown Complex
between 8 September and 11 September are advised to monitor their health
closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for 14
days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to see a doctor
immediately if they feel unwell.
9. We are closely monitoring the clusters listed below, which have
already been ringfenced through tracing, testing and isolation.
