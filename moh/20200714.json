The breakdown of the cases is as follows:<br><br><strong>&nbsp; a)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Imported cases: 2 </strong>(2 Singaporeans)<br><br>There are 2 imported cases today who are both Singaporeans who returned to Singapore from India on 9 July. They had been placed on 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore, and had been tested while serving SHN.<br><br><strong>&nbsp; b)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cases in the community: 7 </strong>(1 Singaporean, 3 Work Pass holders, 3 Work Permit holders)<br><br>Of the 7 cases in the community, 4 were picked up as a result of our proactive surveillance and screening, and 3 had already been placed on quarantine earlier. 6 of the cases are asymptomatic, and were detected through our proactive testing.<br><br>3 of the community cases (Cases 46715, 46716 and 46722) today are linked to previous cases or clusters. They had all been identified as contacts of previously confirmed cases, and had been tested during their quarantine to determine their status, even though they are asymptomatic.<br><br>4 of the community cases are currently unlinked. They are all in the construction sector, and had been swabbed as part of our periodic screening of workers in essential services who are living outside the dormitories. 3 of them (Cases 46385, 46386 and 46387) are asymptomatic.<br><br>Epidemiological investigations of the unlinked cases are in progress. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for their household contacts to determine if these cases could have been infected by them.<br><br>Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 14 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 13 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased, from an average of 6 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 7 per day in the past week.&nbsp;We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br><strong>&nbsp; c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Cases residing in dormitories: 338<br><br></strong>We continue to pick up cases amongst Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, including in factory-converted dormitories, because of extensive testing in these premises, as part of our process to verify and test the status of all workers.&nbsp;<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Details of these trends can be found in MOH\u2019s daily situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report).

Work is ongoing to prepare these dormitories to be declared cleared, and for workers to resume work. We are on track to clear about 80% of workers staying in the dormitories by end-July, and to complete the testing of dormitory residents around mid-August. In the next few days, we have a larger population of migrant workers in various purpose-built dormitories completing their isolation period and being tested for COVID-19. As some of them came from dormitories with higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection, we can expect a higher number of confirmed cases in the next few days from this group of migrant workers.<br><br><strong>Links between previous cases found<br></strong><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In the past week (7 July to 13 July), MOH has uncovered links for 9 previously unlinked cases.<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

Of these, most are stable or improving, and none is in the intensive care unit. 3,704 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 27 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.<br><br>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Case 17168, a 62 year-old male Singapore Citizen, has passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 14 July 2020.

This was based on the erroneous test results submitted by the laboratory. Due to a human error, the laboratory had mislabelled a swab sample from a COVID-19 positive individual as belonging to Case 45655 without properly verifying the patient identifiers of the specimen tubes. Consequently, Case 45655 was recorded as being positive for COVID-19, and was reported to MOH as such.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; The error was discovered upon re-testing of Case 45655 and MOH was informed of the error on 13 July. The mislabelled positive sample belongs to a migrant worker who had been isolated since his swab, and had not been in contact with any other individuals. He is currently well.<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Further testing of the correct sample and new swab samples from the student all produced negative results for COVID-19. The test results for the close contacts who had been placed on quarantine following the first confirmed case at the school (Case 45160) have all tested negative for COVID-19 as well. This means there is no transmission at the school.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; The student had so far been isolated and had not come into contact with any other COVID-19 patients and is therefore not at risk of infection from other patients in the hospital. MOH has informed the Ministry of Education, and rescinded the Quarantine Orders of the close contacts who had previously been placed on quarantine.&nbsp;<br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; MOH takes a serious view of this error. We are investigating this matter, and will take appropriate actions against the laboratory if it is found to be in breach of protocols. In the meantime, the laboratory has reviewed and tightened its processes to prevent a recurrence of the error.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>14 JULY 2020</strong></span></span></p>", "PressCategory": ["Press Releases", "Highlights"], "CustomDetailUrl": "", "UrlName": "mis-reported-covid-19-case-due-to-laboratory-error", "CurrentPageUrl": null}]}, "pressItemDictionaryCount": 1, "allowPagination": true, "selectedCategoryForPagination": "Press Releases", "sectionsListingOrder": ["Press Releases"], "paginationInfoDictionary": {"Press Releases": {"ItemsPerPage": 10, "CurrentPageIndex": 0, "LastPageIndex": 0}}}
