We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Amongst the 180 confirmed cases reported from 28 March to 3 April, 55 cases have tested positive for their serology tests, 85 have tested negative, and 40 serology test results are pending.<br><br><strong>Case Details</strong><br><br><strong>a) Cases in the community: 1<br></strong><br><div>There is 1 case in the community today who is currently unlinked.&nbsp;<br><br>Case 61508 is a 24 year-old female Myanmar national who is a foreign domestic worker. She arrived from Myanmar on 30 January and served SHN at a dedicated facility until 13 February. Her test taken on 12 February during SHN was negative for COVID-19. Following her SHN, she moved into a boarding house for foreign domestic workers while waiting for deployment to an employer, and had not left the boarding house from 13 February to 9 March. On 9 March, she started work at her employer\u2019s residence.<br><br>She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she was swabbed on 1 April as part of MOH\u2019s investigation into Case 61184<sup>1</sup>. As an added precaution, MOH tested all close contacts of Case 61184, including those, like Case 61508, who had interacted with her outside of her infectious period. Case 61508\u2019s test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 2 April, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in an ambulance. Her serological test result has come back positive. She could be shedding minute fragments of the virus RNA from a past infection, but given that we are not able to definitively conclude that she had been infected before her arrival in Singapore, we will take all the necessary public health actions as a precautionary measure.&nbsp;<br><br>Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine if the 2 cases are linked but in the meantime, we have classified Case 61508 as a local unlinked case. All the identified close contacts of the case, including her household members, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>b) Cases residing in dormitories: 0</strong><br><br>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>c) Imported cases: 17<br></strong><br>Amongst the 17 imported cases,&nbsp;<br><br>-&nbsp; 3 (Cases 61525, 61530 and 61534) are Singapore Permanent Residents who returned from Brazil, India and Ivory Coast.<br>-&nbsp; 2 (Cases 61522 and 61529) are Student's Pass holders who arrived from India and the UAE.<br>-&nbsp; 4 (Cases 61528, 61536, 61537 and 61538) are Work Pass holders who arrived from India.<br>-&nbsp; 7 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines, of whom 2 (Cases 61510 and 61531) are foreign domestic workers.<br>-&nbsp; 1 (Case 61517) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder who arrived from Myanmar to visit his family member who is a Singapore Permanent Resident.&nbsp;<br><br>They had all already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annexes6d355520c03247e1ba218d4405d3a397.pdf?sfvrsn=20071256_0\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (w<a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">ww.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epidemiological investigations are in progress.
