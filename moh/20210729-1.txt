UPDATE ON LOCAL COVID-19 SITUATION (29 JULY)


Published Date: 29 Jul 2021

        As of 29 July 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has
confirmed and verified that there are 129 cases of locally transmitted
COVID-19 infection, of which 30 are linked to the Jurong Fishery Port
cluster and 2 belong to the KTV cluster. Of the 129 cases today, 68
are linked to previous cases, and have already been placed on
quarantine. 11 are linked to previous cases and were detected through
surveillance. 50 are currently unlinked. Amongst the cases are 4 seniors
above 70 years who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, and are at
risk of serious illness.

2.     There are 4 imported cases, who have already been placed on
Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or isolated upon arrival in Singapore. 3 were
detected upon arrival in Singapore, while 1 developed the illness during
SHN or isolation.



3.     In total, there are 133 new cases of COVID-19 infection in
Singapore today.

CONDITION OF CONFIRMED CASES



4.     572 cases are currently warded in hospital.  Most are well and
under observation. There are currently 30 cases of serious illness
requiring oxygen supplementation, and 3 in critical condition in the
intensive care unit (ICU). 1 amongst these 33 cases is fully vaccinated,
but requires ICU care as she has underlying medical conditions. 24
seniors above 60 years, of whom 23 are completely unvaccinated or
partially vaccinated, have fallen very ill.

5.     There is continuing evidence that vaccination helps to prevent
serious disease when one gets infected. Over the last 28 days, 39 local
cases required oxygen supplementation, were admitted to ICU or passed
away. 23 are unvaccinated, 15 are partially vaccinated and 1 is fully
vaccinated.

SUMMARY OF TRENDS FOR LOCAL CASES



6.     Overall, the number of new cases in the community has decreased
from 884 cases in the week before to 881 cases in the past week. We are
likely to continue to see high number of cases in the coming days as we
step up efforts to detect them to contain their spread in the community.
The number of unlinked cases in the community has increased from 64
cases in the week before to 238 cases in the past week. The 7-day moving
average number of all linked community cases and all unlinked community
cases are 91.9 and 34.0 respectively.

ACTIVE CLUSTERS UNDER MONITORING

8.     There are 10 new clusters today. In total, there are currently 53
active clusters, ranging between 3 and 969 infections. MOH has been
monitoring existing clusters for any further transmission. As there have
been no more cases linked to the Case 64478 cluster for the past two
incubation periods (i.e. 28 days), the cluster has now been closed.

Collection of ART self-test kits for visitors to selected markets and
food centres
9.     MOH is investigating cases of COVID-19 infection involving
markets and food centres which are likely seeded by fishmongers who
visited Jurong Fishery Port to collect their stock and sell at the
markets and food centres. As an added layer of ringfencing to help to
identify cases and prevent further transmission, MOH is working with the
People’s Association to distribute antigen rapid test (ART) self-test
kits to individuals who had visited selected markets and food centres in
the last 14 days, such as residents living in the vicinity of these
centres. The collection will run from 30 to 31 July 2021 at Residents’
Committee Centres in the vicinity of the following locations:

-   Mayflower Market & Food Centre (162 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4); and

-   Redhill Market (79 Redhill Lane).

10.     Eligible persons are strongly encouraged to collect and perform
self-testing using these ART kits. Please refer to
https://www.gowhere.gov.sg/art to check on the nearest Residents’
Committee Centre for self-collection.
PROGRESS OF NATIONAL VACCINATION PROGRAMME
11.     As of 28 July 2021, we have administered a total of 7,365,873
doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme. The
total number of doses administered was 7,365,873, covering 4,278,760
individuals. 3,208,556 individuals have completed the full vaccination
regimen, consisting of 121,443 recovered persons who received at least
one dose and 3,087,113 who received their second dose. In addition,
95,029 doses of Sinovac vaccines have been administered as of 28 July
2021, covering 71,810 individuals.
