We will tighten our border measures for travellers from Vietnam, given the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam. At the same time, with the improvement in the COVID-19 situation in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, we will adjust our border measures for travellers from NSW, Australia. In addition, to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community for travellers, we will tighten border measures for the Business Travel Pass scheme.</p> <p><strong>Travellers from Vietnam to serve 14-Day SHN at Suitable Place of Residence</strong></p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; We had earlier announced that travellers from Vietnam will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore, without a need to serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN), if their on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test results are negative.</p><p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Given the increased cases observed in Vietnam, we will be tightening border control measures for travellers with travel history to Vietnam. From <strong>12 February 2021</strong><strong>, 2359 hours:</strong></p></p><p>a)&nbsp; &nbsp;Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs) and Long-Term Pass holders entering Singapore with travel history to Vietnam within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore, will be subject to an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, and a PCR test before the end of the SHN period. </p><p>b)&nbsp; &nbsp;Short-term travellers holding an Air Travel Pass (ATP) with travel history to Vietnam within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore, will <u>not</u> be allowed to enter Singapore.</p><p>c)&nbsp; &nbsp;All travellers who are not SCs or PRs will need to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure. These travellers will still be required to undergo an On-Arrival Test (OAT) and serve their SHN upon arrival and be tested at the end of SHN. </p><p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Travellers from Vietnam are allowed to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:<br><br> a)&nbsp; &nbsp;Travelled to no other country/region than above-mentioned country/region [1], in the last consecutive 14 days prior to entry; and<br><br>b)&nbsp; Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.<br></p><p>The COVID-19 tests will continue to be administered before the end of the SHN.</p><p><strong>Travellers from NSW, Australia subject to an On-Arrival Test in lieu of 7D SHN</strong></p><p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Since 23 December 2020, 2359 hours, SCs, PRs and Long-Term Pass holders entering Singapore with travel history to NSW, Australia within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore, have been subjected to a 7-day SHN at their place of residence with a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of their SHN period. Short-term visitors holding an ATP with travel history to NSW, Australia within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore have not been allowed to enter Singapore.</p><p><p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;The COVID-19 situation in NSW, Australia has since improved, with no local community cases recorded over the last 21 days. Given this, we will adjust our border control measures for travellers with travel history to NSW, Australia. From <strong>10 February 2021, 2359 hours</strong>, SCs, PRs and Long-Term Pass holders returning from NSW, Australia will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at the airport in lieu of a 7-day SHN, and if the result is negative, they will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore.<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;Short-term visitors travelling from NSW, Australia can also apply for an ATP for entry into Singapore on or after <strong>16 February 2021 [2]</strong>. They will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at the airport in lieu of a 7-day SHN, and if the result is negative, they will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore.</p></p><p><p><strong>Revised Border Measures for the BTP Scheme<br><br></strong>8.<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The Business Travel Pass (BTP) scheme was introduced in June 2020 to facilitate essential business travel for senior executives based in Singapore with regional or international responsibilities who need to travel regularly for work.</p></p><p><p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; BTP travellers are required to abide by a strict controlled itinerary when travelling. Upon return, BTP travellers will undergo an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in lieu of the SHN and are required to be isolated in a single location until they obtain a negative result for their OAT. In addition, travellers are required to use TraceTogether, avoid all forms of public transport within 14 days of return, comply with safe management measures at their workplace and abide by all other prevailing measures applicable to local residents. <br><br>10.&nbsp; &nbsp;As an added precautionary measure, travellers on this scheme are now required to undergo COVID-19 PCR Tests on <strong>Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14</strong> of their return. An additional serology test will also be required on Day 3. These enhanced testing requirements serve to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community. Travellers are also to avoid events with more than 8 attendees within 14 days of returning to Singapore.</p></p><p><p>11.&nbsp; &nbsp;As compliance to the border measures in this scheme is crucial to safeguarding public health and helping to curb potential transmission of COVID-19 to the community, BTP holders must comply with the border measures in this scheme or risk having their BTPs revoked.</p></p><p><p>12.&nbsp; &nbsp;We will continue to carefully monitor the global situation and the public health outcomes from this scheme in order to strike a calibrated balance between the safety of the local community and resuming business travel in support of our overall economic recovery.</p></p><p><p><strong>Regular Review of Border Measures</strong></p><p>13.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the <a href=\"https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">SafeTravel website</a>. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and treatment.</p></p><p><p>14.&nbsp; &nbsp;All travellers are reminded to accurately declare their travel history.
