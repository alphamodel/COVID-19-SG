Case 60086 arrived from Indonesia to visit her Singaporean spouse. Case 60088 arrived from Bangladesh as a caregiver to her spouse who was already receiving medical care in Singapore.<br><br>Amongst them, 10 had already been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.&nbsp;<br><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Case 60102</span><br><br>Case 60102 is a 41 year-old female Singaporean who works as a cabin crew with Singapore Airlines. She departed Singapore on 30 January on a turnaround flight to the UAE, and returned on 1 February without disembarking from the aircraft at the overseas destination.&nbsp;<br><br>She developed anosmia on 4 February, but did not seek medical attention. On 7 February, she was tested for COVID-19 as part of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\u2019s requirement for air crew to be tested following their return from overseas. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for an individual swab, and isolated. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her previous test on 22 January following another turnaround flight was negative for COVID-19. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests.&nbsp;<br><br>Case 60102 received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2 February. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, she could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides Case 60102, 4 passengers on the same flight (Cases 59885, 59893, 59901 and 59902) have tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and are also preliminarily positive for the B117 strain. In view of her recent travel history, and the possibility that she might have been infected onboard the flight, we have preliminarily classified this case as imported.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including her family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please refer to the <a href=\"/docs/librariesprovider5/pressroom/press-releases/annexes---9-feb-2021.pdf?sfvrsn=5a6f8075_2\" title=\"Annexes\">Annexes</a>&nbsp;and MOH\u2019s daily Situation Report (<a href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report\" title=\"\" class=\"\" target=\"\">www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report</a>) for details.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Update on condition of confirmed cases</strong><br><br>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 22 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.

In addition, to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community for travellers, we will tighten border measures for the Business Travel Pass scheme.</p> <p><strong>Travellers from Vietnam to serve 14-Day SHN at Suitable Place of Residence</strong></p> <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; We had earlier announced that travellers from Vietnam will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore, without a need to serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN), if their on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test results are negative.</p><p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Given the increased cases observed in Vietnam, we will be tightening border control measures for travellers with travel history to Vietnam.

Short-term visitors holding an ATP with travel history to NSW, Australia within the last 14 days before departure for Singapore have not been allowed to enter Singapore.</p><p><p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;The COVID-19 situation in NSW, Australia has since improved, with no local community cases recorded over the last 21 days. Given this, we will adjust our border control measures for travellers with travel history to NSW, Australia. From <strong>10 February 2021, 2359 hours</strong>, SCs, PRs and Long-Term Pass holders returning from NSW, Australia will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at the airport in lieu of a 7-day SHN, and if the result is negative, they will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore.<br><br>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;Short-term visitors travelling from NSW, Australia can also apply for an ATP for entry into Singapore on or after <strong>16 February 2021 [2]</strong>. They will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival at the airport in lieu of a 7-day SHN, and if the result is negative, they will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore.</p></p><p><p><strong>Revised Border Measures for the BTP Scheme<br><br></strong>8.<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>The Business Travel Pass (BTP) scheme was introduced in June 2020 to facilitate essential business travel for senior executives based in Singapore with regional or international responsibilities who need to travel regularly for work.</p></p><p><p>9.&nbsp; &nbsp; BTP travellers are required to abide by a strict controlled itinerary when travelling. Upon return, BTP travellers will undergo an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in lieu of the SHN and are required to be isolated in a single location until they obtain a negative result for their OAT. In addition, travellers are required to use TraceTogether, avoid all forms of public transport within 14 days of return, comply with safe management measures at their workplace and abide by all other prevailing measures applicable to local residents. <br><br>10.&nbsp; &nbsp;As an added precautionary measure, travellers on this scheme are now required to undergo COVID-19 PCR Tests on <strong>Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14</strong> of their return. An additional serology test will also be required on Day 3. These enhanced testing requirements serve to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community. Travellers are also to avoid events with more than 8 attendees within 14 days of returning to Singapore.</p></p><p><p>11.&nbsp; &nbsp;As compliance to the border measures in this scheme is crucial to safeguarding public health and helping to curb potential transmission of COVID-19 to the community, BTP holders must comply with the border measures in this scheme or risk having their BTPs revoked.</p></p><p><p>12.&nbsp; &nbsp;We will continue to carefully monitor the global situation and the public health outcomes from this scheme in order to strike a calibrated balance between the safety of the local community and resuming business travel in support of our overall economic recovery.</p></p><p><p><strong>Regular Review of Border Measures</strong></p><p>13.&nbsp; &nbsp;As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community.
