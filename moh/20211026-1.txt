1.    Over the last 28 days, 98.7% of local infected cases were

2.    As of 26 October 2021, 289 cases require oxygen supplementation in
the general ward, 79 are unstable and under close monitoring in the ICU
to prevent further deterioration, and 67 are critically ill and
intubated in the ICU. The current overall ICU utilisation rate is
79.2%.
3.    MOH has been working with the hospitals to set aside more ICU beds
for COVID-19 patients, as and when we need them. In view of the current
ICU occupancy rates, we have triggered the next 100 ICU beds, which will
be ready next week. While we are able to stand up ICU beds at short
notice, the increased load of patients adds strain and pressure on the
healthcare system and our healthcare workers. We encourage everyone to
get vaccinated if they have not done so, so as to protect themselves and
help ease the patient load on the healthcare system. For those who are
not vaccinated, we urge them to minimise unnecessary movement and social
interactions.

complications due to COVID-19 infection. All except an unvaccinated case
had various underlying medical conditions.
