    <body><h1>Second Covid-19 Vaccine Authorised for Use In Singapore</h1>
    <p>Published Date: 03 Feb 2021</p> <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The government welcomes the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination’s endorsement of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for use in Singapore in individuals aged 18 years and above. This follows the Health Sciences Authority’s (HSA) authorisation of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). The&nbsp; Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is the second COVID-19 vaccine to be authorised for pandemic use by HSA, after the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.<br><br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;We will progressively roll out the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for individuals aged 18 years and above when shipments of the vaccine arrive. We expect the first shipment to arrive around March 2021, if there are no disruptions to the shipment schedule.&nbsp;<br><br>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;More vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive over the course of the year. We will continue to monitor our supplies closely to ensure that we will have enough vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore by the third quarter of 2021.&nbsp;<br><br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; As of 2 February 2021, more than 175,000 individuals have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. About 6,000 of them have also received their second dose of the vaccine, and completed the full vaccination regimen. In two weeks’ time, they will be adequately protected against COVID-19.&nbsp;<br><br>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Vaccination is critical to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19. Vaccination also protects those in our community who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. While COVID-19 vaccination will be voluntary, we strongly encourage everyone who is medically eligible for vaccination to get vaccinated when the vaccine is offered, to better protect ourselves and our loved ones.&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>MINISTRY OF HEALTH<br>3 FEBRUARY 2021</strong><br></span></span></p><div><br></div></body>
