She travelled to India from 30 November 2020 and returned to Singapore on 6 January 2021. Her pre-departure test taken in India on 4 January before her flight was negative for COVID-19. Upon her return, she served SHN at a dedicated facility until 20 January. Her swab done on 17 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19.<br><br>She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 2 February in preparation for another trip to India. Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital in an ambulance.<br><br>We have classified this case as locally transmitted while her serology test result is pending. Should her serology test come back positive, and epidemiological investigations assess that this is a past infection, we will reclassify this as an imported case. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including her family members, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them.<br><br><strong>b)&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cases residing in dormitories: 0<br><br></strong>There are no cases residing in dormitories today.<br><br><strong>c)&nbsp;Imported cases: 17<br><br></strong>Amongst the 17 imported cases,</span></p></p><p><ul><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">1 (Case 59919) is a Singapore Permanent Resident who returned from India.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">1 (Case 59925) is a Work Pass holder who arrived from India.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">14 are Work Permit holders who arrived from Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia, of whom 9 (Cases 59912, 59913, 59914, 59924, 59930, 59931, 59932, 59933 and 59934) are foreign domestic workers.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px;">1 (Case 59915) is a sea crew holding a Special Pass who arrived from Indonesia to board a vessel docked here.
